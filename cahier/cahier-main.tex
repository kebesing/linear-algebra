\chapter*{Introduction}

This is a \emph{workbook}. 
It is a collection of tasks that you should do to try to learn linear algebra for yourself.

It is not a \emph{textbook}. We don't have a textbook, as such things are understood today. We have a primer, the first volume of this set: \emph{Livre des Lignes}, which
should serve as a basic source for reading about the main ideas, and we have this workbook. The books are separate so that you may have them both open at once. I hope this works.


It is important to focus on your own understanding when working on these tasks. At every stage possible, you should ask yourself, "Self, how do I know this?" and maybe also, "So, Self, do I know this for sure? Or do I still have doubts?"

If you are feeling at a loss for how to explain your thinking, try relying on simple geometric models and reasoning. It turns out that most of even the fanciest linear algebra is done that way. So, "Self, can you draw the relevant picture? Does that help?"

Good luck. I'll see you in class, and I welcome your visits to office hours to talk about mathematics.

\chapter{Vectors and Lines the Plane}
\label{ch:one}

\section*{Points and Vectors}

\begin{task}
Write down three distinct points in the plane in proper notation. 
Plot those three points on a single diagram.
\end{task}

\begin{task}
Write down three distinct vectors in the plane in proper notation. 
Your three points from this task should NOT match any of the three points from the previous task.
Plot those three vectors on a single diagram.
\end{task}

\begin{definition}
If $u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_n$ is a collection of vectors, and $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots$ is a collection of scalars, then the vector formed below is called a \emph{linear combination}\marginnote{Defintion: Linear Combinations} of the $u_i$'s.
\[
\lambda_1 u_1 + \lambda_2 u_2 + \dots \lambda_n u_n
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{task}
Find the sum of your three vectors from the last exercise. Then, choose some order of those three vectors so that they are $u_1$, $u_2$ and $u_3$, and compute the linear combination
\[
3u_1 - 2u_2 + (1/2)u_3.
\] 
\end{task}

\begin{task}
Let's consider the vectors $u=\left(\begin{smallmatrix} 2 \\1 \end{smallmatrix}\right)$, 
$v=\left(\begin{smallmatrix} 1\\ 1 \end{smallmatrix}\right)$, and $w=\left(\begin{smallmatrix} -3\\ 1 \end{smallmatrix}\right)$.
Compute all of the vectors in this list:
\[
\dfrac{u+v}{2}, v-u, v-w, u + \left(\dfrac{v-u}{3}\right), u + \left(\dfrac{3(v-u)}{4}\right)
\]
Then make a single diagram which contains $u$, $v$, $w$ and all of those vectors from the list, plotted as accurately as you can.

What do you notice? Is anything interesting going on?
\end{task}

\begin{task}
Consider the vector $u = \left(\begin{smallmatrix} -4 \\ 2\end{smallmatrix}\right)$. Find a vector $v$ which has the property that $u+v$ is the zero vector, or explain why this is not possible.
\end{task}

\begin{definition}
An equation of the form $\lambda_1 u_1 + \dots \lambda_n u_n = w$, where all of the vectors $u_i$ and $w$ are known, but the scalars $\lambda_i$ are unknown, is called a \emph{linear combination of vectors equation}.
\marginnote{Definition: Linear Combination Equations and their Solutions}
A \emph{solution} to such an equation is 
a collection of scalars which make the equation true.
\end{definition}

\begin{task}
For now, keep $u = \left(\begin{smallmatrix} -4 \\ 2\end{smallmatrix}\right)$. 
Let $v = \left(\begin{smallmatrix} 3 \\ 5 \end{smallmatrix}\right)$.
How many solutions does the linear combination of vectors equation
$\lambda u = v$
have?

How many solutions does the linear combination of vectors equation 
$\lambda u + \mu v = 0$
have? (Here, treat $0$ as the zero vector.)
\end{task}

\begin{task}
We still use the notation $u$ for the vector $u = \left(\begin{smallmatrix} -4 \\ 2\end{smallmatrix}\right)$, but now use $v$ for the vector $v = \left(\begin{smallmatrix} 28 \\ -14\end{smallmatrix}\right)$.
How many solutions does the linear combination of vectors equation $\lambda u = v$
have?

How many solutions does the linear combination of vectors equation 
$\lambda u + \mu v = 0$ have? (Again, treat $0$ as the zero vector.)
\end{task}

\begin{task}
Find the midpoint between the points $P = (4,-2)$ and $Q=(3,5)$. Then find the two points which divide the segment $PQ$ into thirds.

How can vectors make this simpler than it first appears?
\end{task}

\begin{challenge}
Suppose you are given three points in the plane. Let's call them $P$, $Q$, and $R$.
How can you use vectors to (quickly) determine if these three points are collinear?
\end{challenge}

\section*{Parametric Lines in the Plane}

\begin{task}
Write down five different points which lie on the line described parametrically as:
\[
t \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} -5\\3 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix}1\\-1/2\end{pmatrix}.
\]
\end{task}


\begin{challenge}
How many different solutions\marginnote{Recall the definition above.} to the equation
\[
x\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 7\end{pmatrix} + y \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ 14 \end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -7 \end{pmatrix}
\]
can you find? How many are they? Can you find a good way to describe all of the solutions? Is there a natural geometric way to describe all of the solutions? Is there an algebraic way to describe all of the solutions?
\end{challenge}


\begin{task}\label{task:line-through-origin}
Write down a parametric description for the line which passes through the origin $O=(0,0)$ and the 
point $S = (-5,5)$.

Is this the \emph{only} way to write down such a parametric description for that line?
\end{task}


\begin{task}\label{task:line-through-points}
Write down a parametric description for the line which passes through the points below.
\[
 T = (\pi, 0), \qquad J = (0,-\pi)
\]
Now find a different parametric description for that line. (\emph{Hint: Can you find a way to write a parametric description that doesn't use the number $\pi$?})
\end{task}

Compare the lines from the tasks \ref{task:line-through-origin} and \ref{task:line-through-points}. Do you note anything interesting? How do you know your observation is true?

\item unit vectors which point in the same directions as $u$ and $v$, respectively; and
\item the angle between $u$ and $v$.
\end{compactitem}
\end{task}

The next three tasks all involve linear combination equations. You may find it useful to review what that phrase means, and also what it means to find a solution to such an equation.


\begin{task}
This task concerns linear combination equations of the form $\lambda u = v$ for $3$-vectors $u$ and $v$ and a scalar $\lambda$.
\begin{compactitem}
\item Can you make an example of this equation which has no solutions? If so, make one. If not, explain why it is impossible.
\item Can you make an example of this equation which has exactly one solution?  If so, make one. If not, explain why it is impossible.
\item Can you make an example of this equation which has exactly two solutions?  If so, make one. If not, explain why it is impossible.
\item Can you make an example of this equation which has infinitely many solutions? If so, make one. If not, explain why it is impossible.
\end{compactitem}
\end{task}

\begin{task}
This task concerns linear combination equations of the form $\lambda u +\mu v=w$ for $3$-vectors $u$, $v$, and $w$ and scalars $\lambda$, and $\mu$.
\begin{compactitem}
\item Can you make an example of this equation which has no solutions? If so, make one. If not, explain why it is impossible.
\item Can you make an example of this equation which has exactly one solution? If so, make one. If not, explain why it is impossible.
\item Can you make an example of this equation which has exactly two solutions?  If so, make one. If not, explain why it is impossible.
\item Can you make an example of this equation which has infinitely many solutions? If so, make one. If not, explain why it is impossible.
\end{compactitem}
\end{task}

\begin{task}
This task concerns linear combination equations of the form $x u_1 + y u_2 + z u_3 = b$ for $3$-vectors $u_1$, $u_2$, $u_3$ and $b$ and scalars $x$, $y$, and $z$.
\begin{compactitem}
\item Can you make an example of this equation which has no solutions? If so, make one. If not, explain why it is impossible.
\item Can you make an example of this equation which has exactly one solution? If so, make one. If not, explain why it is impossible.
\item Can you make an example of this equation which has exactly two solutions?  If so, make one. If not, explain why it is impossible.
\item Can you make an example of this equation which has infinitely many solutions? If so, make one. If not, explain why it is impossible.
\end{compactitem}
\end{task}

\begin{challenge}
Suppose that we are given a line in the plane described parametrically as 
$t \mapsto t\left(\begin{smallmatrix} -2 \\ 5\end{smallmatrix}\right)$,
and a point $P = (7,4)$. Find the coordinates of the point $Q$ which (1) lies on the line and (2) which is, of all the points on the line, \emph{closest} to $P$.
\end{challenge}

\begin{definition}
Let $n$ be a counting number. We define an $n$-vector to be a vertical stack of $n$ real numbers, like so:
\[
u = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ \vdots \\ u_n \end{pmatrix} .
\]
The individual entries $u_i$ of $u$ are called its \emph{components}.
The collection of all $n$-vectors is called \emph{$n$-space}, and denoted $\mathbb{R}^n$.

We may form \emph{linear combinations} of $n$-vectors by doing scalar multiplication and addition in a component-by-component fashion.

Similarly, the notions of dot product, norm, and angle extend in the expected way to $n$-vectors.
\end{definition}

\begin{task}
Create an example of five different $6$-vectors, call them $v_1, v_2, \ldots v_5$. Make sure that at most one component of each vector is equal to zero. Then choose five different non-zero scalars $x_1, x_2, \ldots x_5$. Compute the linear combination
\[
x_1 v_1 + x_2 v_2 + x_3 v_3 + x_4 v_4 + x_5 v_5.
\]
\end{task}

\begin{task}
Using the vectors $v_1$ and $v_2$ from your work in the last task, compute the following:
\begin{compactitem}
\item The dot product of $v_1$ and $v_2$;
\item The norms of $v_1$ and $v_2$;
\item Unit vectors which point in the same directions as $v_1$ and $v_2$, respectively; and
\item The angle between $v_1$ and $v_2$.
\end{compactitem}
\end{task}


\begin{task} This task has three parts:
\begin{compactitem}
\item[a)] Create an example of a linear combination equation for vectors $u, v, w$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ of the form $x u + y v = w$ which has no solution.
\item[b)] Uncouple your vectors to rewrite your linear combination equation as an equivalent system of three linear equations on the variables $x$ and $y$.
\item[c)] How should we interpret this system of linear equations? What kind of thing does each equation describe?
\end{compactitem}
\end{task}


\begin{task}
Repeat the last task, but instead, work with vectors $u, v, w$ in $\mathbb{R}^4$.
\end{task}


\begin{task}
Consider the line in the plane given parametrically by 
\[
t \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1\end{pmatrix}.
\]
Find the coordinates of the point lying on this line which is closest to the point $P = (1,5)$.
\end{task}


\begin{task}
Consider the line in the plane which is the set of solutions the equation $4x-7y=-15$. Find the point on that line which is closest to the point $Q=(-5,0)$.
\end{task}

\begin{task}
Make an example of a linear combination equation 
\[
xv_1 + y v_2 + z v_3 = b
\]
for $3$-vectors $v_1, v_2, v_3, b$ which has no solution, or say why such an example is not possible.
\end{task}
