\section*{The Idea of a Subspace}

\begin{task} Use the definition of the word \emph{subspace} to decide if each subset is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^2$:
\begin{compactenum}
\item[a.] The set consisting of only the zero vector $\mathcal{Z} = \{\left(\begin{smallmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{smallmatrix}\right)\}$.
\item[b.] The set consisting of the vectors whose heads lie on the circle of radius of radius $7$ about the origin.
\item[c.] The set consisting of those vectors which have their heads on either the $x$-axis or the $y$-axis.
\end{compactenum}
\end{task}

\begin{task} Use the definition of the word \emph{subspace} to decide if each subset is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$:
\begin{compactenum}
\item[a.] The set of all vectors which are linear combinations of the vectors $e_1, e_2, e_3$:
\[
e_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad e_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad e_3 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
\item[b.] The set of solutions of the equation $2x + 3y = 6$.
\item[c.] The set of vectors which are solutions of the equation $x^2+y^2-z^2 = 0$.
\end{compactenum}
\end{task}

\begin{task}
Experiment with some possibilities. What kinds of shapes can the subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^2$ be?
\end{task}

\begin{task}
Experiment with some possibilities. What kinds of shapes can the subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^3$ be?
\end{task}

\begin{task}
Run through the argument for Theorem 37 in the particular example of 
\[
\mathrm{Span}\left\{\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \right\}.
\]
Do you recognize this subspace? Is there an easier way to describe it?
\end{task}

\begin{task}
Show that the set of solutions to the system of equations below is not a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$, by showing that it actually fails \emph{both} conditions in the definition.
\[
\left\{ \begin{array}{rrrrrrr}
x_1 &+& 2x_2 &+& 3x_3 &=& 4 \\
x_1 &-& 2x_2 &+& 3x_3 &=& 0
\end{array}\right.
\]
How could we repair this task? Find a way to make a small change to the system of equations so that the set of solutions is a subspace. How are the two solution sets related? 
\end{task}

\section{Spans vs. Homogeneous Systems}

In the next three tasks, you are given a subspace described as the solution set of a homogeneous system of linear equations. Find a way to describe that same subspace as a span.

\begin{task} The subspace $\mathcal{S}_1$ is the set of solutions in $\mathbb{R}^2$ to the system of equations
\[
\left\{\begin{array}{rrrrr}
2x & + & y & = & 5 \\
x & + & y & = & 7
\end{array}\right. .
\]
\end{task}

\begin{task} The subspace $\mathcal{S}_2$ is the set of solutions in $\mathbb{R}^3$ to the system of equations
\[
\left\{\begin{array}{rrrrrrr}
x & + & 2y & + & 3z & = & 0 \\
4x & + & 5y & + & 6z & = & 0 \\
7x & + & 8y & + & 9z & = & 0 \\
\end{array}\right. .
\]
\end{task}

\begin{task} The subspace $\mathcal{S}_3$ is the set of solutions in $\mathbb{R}^4$ to the system of equations
\[
\left\{\begin{array}{rrrrrrrrr}
x_1 & + & x_2 & + & x_3 & + & x_4 & = & 0 \\
    &   & x_2 & - & x_3 & - & 2x_4 & = & 0 \\
    &   & x_2 & + & 3x_3 &  &  & = & 0
\end{array}\right. .
\]
\end{task}


In the next three tasks, you are given a subspace described as a span. Find a homogeneous system of linear equations whose solution set is the given subspace.

\begin{task} The subspace $\mathcal{S}_4$ is the span of the $2$-vectors below.
\[
u_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, \quad u_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} 
\]
For what value of $n$ is $\mathcal{S}_4$ a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$?
\end{task}

\begin{task} The subspace $\mathcal{S}_5$ is the span of the $3$-vectors below.
\[
w_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ 1\end{pmatrix}, \quad w_2 =\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} 
\]
For what value of $n$ is $\mathcal{S}_5$ a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$?
\end{task}

\begin{task} The subspace $\mathcal{S}_6$ is the span of the $4$-vectors below.
\[
v_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, \quad v_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1\\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} , \quad v_3 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 4 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]
For what value of $n$ is $\mathcal{S}_6$ a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$?
\end{task}
