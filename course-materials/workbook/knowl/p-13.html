<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>The first two vectors above are called <em class="terminology">column</em> vectors
        because they are stacked vertically. The third is called a <em class="terminology">row</em> vector because it is arranged horizontally. For this class, we will always use column vectors, but to save space, we might sometimes write them as row vectors. It is up to you to make the switch. (We will see later how this matters!)</p><span class="incontext"><a href="vectors.html#p-13">in-context</a></span>
