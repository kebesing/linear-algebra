      The dot product is a funny kind of multiplication. It plays an important
      role in mathematics because it captures all of the basics of measurement.
      We shall learn how to use the dot product to measure lengths and angles. By
      its definition, the dot product is connected with the concept of a linear
      equation, so it will make frequent appearances in our work.
