<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>There are a few new SageMath commands that might be useful here. We have
      already seen how to take linear equations and turn them into vectors
      and then turn the vector equation into a matrix equation. But SageMath can
      help us move in the other direction, too.
