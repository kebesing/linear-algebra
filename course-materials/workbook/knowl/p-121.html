          Playing with all of the equations is nice, but all that really
          matters is the collection of coefficients, and the numbers on the
          right hand sides of the equal signs. Experienced solvers get tired
          of copying notation from line to line in a computation, so they only
          keep track of the matrix of coefficients, <em class="terminology">augmented</em> by
          the vector on the right-hand side. In the example above, that
          augmented matrix is
          \begin{equation*}
            \augmatrix{ccc}{
            3 &amp; 2 &amp; -\pi &amp; 0 \\ -4 &amp; -33 &amp; 1 &amp; 12
            }
          \end{equation*}
          All of the row operations can be performed on just this augmented
          matrix, without losing any of the essential information.
