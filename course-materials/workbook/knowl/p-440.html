        But data found in scientific problems is often noisy, or infected with
        error in some way. This leads researchers to gather <!--Style me with CSS--><em>more</em> data
        so that chance variations and small errors might get smoothed out.  How
        might we fit a curve to a lot of data? Lots of data points means that we
        likely have too many points to have a curve of our specified model type
        actually hit all of those points.
