        See how the pattern fits? Several weeks worth of data about the position
        of Ceres was known, but it surely had measurement errors in it. Since
        the time of Kepler (Newton), we have known that the motion of the
        asteroid must be an ellipse. This is a simple equation with only a few
        parameters (the coefficients of the equation defining the ellipse). So,
        the question confronting Gauss was this: find the ellipse which best
        fits the data.
