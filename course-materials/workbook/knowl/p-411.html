      The basic idea is that two spaces are orthogonal complements if they are
      orthogonal, and together they contain enough vectors to span the entire
      space. The definition looks like it is a one-directional thing: for a
      subspace, you find its orthogonal complement. But really it is a
      <!--Style me with CSS--><em>complementary</em> relationship. If \(W\) is the orthogonal
      complement to \(V\), then \(V\) is the orthogonal complement to
      \(W\).
