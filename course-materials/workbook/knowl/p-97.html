      We will begin with a study of the two ways that vectors let us make pictures
      of systems of linear equations. Then we take up a basic process for finding
      solutions, where matrices will appear as a convenient notational device.
      But as we dig a little further, matrices will become interesting in their
      own way, so we will study those. But what we study will relate back to
      the fundamental issue of solving systems of linear equations.
