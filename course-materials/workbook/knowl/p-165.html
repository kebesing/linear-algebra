<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>Now we take a short break to revisit and consolidate the learning you
      have done so far. Revisit the reading and the exercises you have done in
      Chapter Two: Linear Equations. The important feature of this work should be
      learning to think about your own thinking. This sort of <em class="terminology">meta-cognition</em>
      characterizes expert learners. Eventually, you want to be able to monitor
      your work at all times and recognize when you understand deeply and when
      you do not. This will allow you to self-correct.
