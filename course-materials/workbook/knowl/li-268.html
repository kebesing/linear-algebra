</h5>The RREF is good for several things. One that is often overlooked is
        that one can use it to rewrite the system of equations in a “simplest
        form.” I mean that the equations left over in the RREF are somehow
        the easiest equations to use to cut out the solution as an intersection
        of hyperplanes.
