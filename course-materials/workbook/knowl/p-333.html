<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>
      What has happened here is that SageMath constructs a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>different</em> version
      of the nullspace matrix than Strang does. Strang's version is easier to
      find by hand and tends to have \(1\)'s and \(0\)'s and the end.
      The SageMath version comes from a routine that strongly prefers to
      start with \(1\)'s and \(0\)'s.
