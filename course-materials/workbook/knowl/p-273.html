        Here is the important stuff to remember:
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li id="li-224">A row swap is performed by a permutation matrix. A permutation matrix
            is a matrix with exactly one \(1\) in each column and in each row.
            These matrices have the important property that their transposes and
            their inverses are equal. That is, if \(P\) is a permutation matrix,
            then \(P^T\) is equal to \(P^{-1}\). (Not every matrix with
            this extra property is a permutation matrix. Be careful.)
          </li>
<li id="li-225">
            It is possible to figure out what all of the row swaps should be, and
            then rearrange all of the amtrices in an LU decomposition routine.
            If you do it correctly, you get:
            \begin{equation*}
              P'A = LU
            \end{equation*}
            or
            \begin{equation*}
              A = PLU
            \end{equation*}
            where \(P'\) and \(P\) are permutation matrices.
          </li>
</ol>
