      This means it might be interesting to think about how \(A\) moves a
      vector about inside of \(\mathbb{R}^n\). Usually, the vector \(v\)
      will get turned into a vector \(Av\) which has a different length and
      points in a completely different direction. But sometimes, sometimes,
      \(v\) and \(Av\) will point in the same direction. This is an eigenvector.
