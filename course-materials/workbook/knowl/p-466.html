      Strang lists 10 important properties of determinants in this section,
      and verifies them for \(2\times 2\) matrices. The verifications for
      general matrices aren't any harder, but they sure are longer,
      so I am glad he skipped them. Anyway, these properties are enough to get
      by when it is time to compute. In fact, clever use of these properties
      can save you a lot of time.
