      A running theme for this course is the use of the SageMath mathematical software
      system. In order to get started, the second section of this course is
      dedicated to getting started with SageMath using the SageMathCloud (SMC). You will
      make an account and run through an introductory workshop with SMC.
      Also, throughout this workbook you will find little embedded pieces of SageMath
      code. These are implemented using the SageMath SingleCell server. Most of these
      SageMath cells are mutable. You can change the content in them and re-evaluate
      your new SageMath code. I encourage you to play with these---it is a good way to
      learn the basics of SageMath.
