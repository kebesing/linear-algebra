      As Strang discusses, the eigenvalues are found as roots of the
      <em class="terminology">characteristic polynomial</em> \(\det(A-\lambda \cdot I) = 0\).
      That's right, we only need to find the roots of a polynomial! Sounds great,
      but as a general thing this is pretty hard. Don't get too excited. Have you
      heard this fact before? It is both depressing and interesting: there is no
      general formula to find the roots of a polynomial of degree 5 or more.
