      This is an instance of the beginnings of <!--Style me with CSS--><em>Modern Algebra</em>, which
      is the study of the algebraic structures of abstracted objects. In this
      case, we study whole collections of matrices of a common shape, and we
      try to treat them like generalized numbers. Then the natural questions
      are how much like “regular numbers” are these matrices?
