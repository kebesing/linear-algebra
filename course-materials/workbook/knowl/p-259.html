        Gauss-Jordan elimination is easy enough to understand, now. It is time
        to let go of performing all those arithmetic operations by hand. So,
        permutation matrices become important for a different reason! Even if
        Gauss-Jordan elimination can be done without a row swap, it may be
        numerically better for a computer to swap out for a larger number as a
        pivot, so a row swap is used anyway. This partial pivoting strategy is
        encapsulated in most computer algebra algorithms in some way, and is
        part of the computation involved in computing a PLU decomposition.
        Strang has a decent discussion of the choices, below we will
        discuss how SageMath handles this.
