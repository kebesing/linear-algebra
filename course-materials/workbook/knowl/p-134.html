        Each of these viewpoints has its advantages when talking about the
        geometry of linear algebra. But one way that things steadily improve as
        you move down the page is in the amount of notational baggage.
        From each version to the next, we lose repetitive bits of symbol that
        one can just remember from context.
        Often, this is taken one step further! We now throw away the unknowns,
        the equal signs and some of the parentheses surrounding the matrices and
        vectors, and just write an <em class="terminology">augmented</em> matrix.
        \begin{equation*}
          \augmatrix{ccc}{
          0 &amp;3 &amp;2 &amp;8\\ 1 &amp;-1 &amp;1 &amp;-1\\ 3 &amp;2 &amp;3 &amp;1
          }
        \end{equation*}
        This is the minimum fuss way to keep track of all the information you
        need to solve the original system.
