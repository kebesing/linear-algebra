      Two orthogonal subspaces always have as intersection the trivial subspace
      \(\{ 0\}\). The reason for this is that if some vector \(x\) lay in
      both \(V\) and \(W\), then we must have that \(x \cdot x =0\).
      (Think of the first \(x\) as lying in \(V\), and the second in
      \(W\).) But the properties of the dot product then mean that \(x\)
      is the zero vector.
