      It is often more clear to describe a matrix by giving the sizes of its
      rows and columns. An \(m\) by \(n\) matrix is one having \(m\)
      rows and \(n\) columns. It is really easy to get these reversed, so be
      careful. For example, this is a \(2\times 3\) matrix, because it has
      two rows and three columns:\begin{equation*}
        B = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\ 3 &amp; 5 &amp; 8 \end{pmatrix}
      \end{equation*}
      A matrix is called a <em class="terminology">square</em> matrix when the number of rows and
      the number of columns is equal. The matrix \(A\) that I wrote down
      above is square because it is a \(2\times 2\) matrix.
