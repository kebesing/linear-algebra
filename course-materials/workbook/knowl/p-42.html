<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>Be sure that you have login access to computers in student labs across
          campus. Before class, drop by a campus lab and make sure your credentials
          work properly and you can sign in to a machine. For our lab session
          we will use one of the labs on the first floor of Wright Hall, so one
          of those would make a good choice.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="start-sage.html#p-42">in-context</a></span>
