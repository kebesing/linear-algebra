<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>To help you get started with meta-cognition, I listed learning goals in
      each section. To go further, you need to explicitly go through the process
      of reviewing what you can do and what you cannot. Here are some prompts to
      help you get started with this process.
      <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li id="li-488">
          Review the learning goals from each section. Can you do the things
          described? Can you do them sometimes, or have you mastered them so you
          can do them consistently?
        </li>
<li id="li-489">
          Look through all of the tasks and go deeper into them. Can you
          connect each exercise to one of our pictures? Try to build a mental
          model of how the exercise and its solution work.
        </li>
<li id="li-490">
          If your first solution to an exercise involve a “guess-and-check”
          approach, can you now complete the exercise in a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>purposeful</em>
          and systematic manner?
        </li>
<li id="li-491">
          Make a list of concepts or exercises that are not clear to you. Phrase
          each item in your list as a question, and make each question as
          specific as possible. Talk with fellow students or your
          instructor until you can answer your own questions.
        </li>
</ul>
