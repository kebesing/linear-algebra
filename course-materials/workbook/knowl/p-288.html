      The key concepts in this section are those of a <em class="terminology">vector space</em>
      and of a <em class="terminology">subspace</em>. The basic idea is that a vector space is
      a kind of place where the basic operations involved in a linear
      combination make sense. There is a set of rules for being a vector space,
      but they are all aimed at the fact that there are two operations
      (addition and scalar multiplication) and we can form linear combinations
      with them that make sense.
