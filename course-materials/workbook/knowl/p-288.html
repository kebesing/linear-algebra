        We have seen that elimination sometimes requires us to perform a row
        operation of swapping the position of two rows to put a pivot in a good
        place. At first, we want to do this to avoid a zero. But for computational
        reasons, a machine really likes to have a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>big</em> number as a pivot.
        So software often uses rows swaps even when not strictly needed.
