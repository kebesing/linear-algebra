      For now, the transpose will feel like some random thing, but its primary
      importance comes from its connection with the dot product. If we think of
      column vectors \(u\) and \(v\) of size \(n\) as if they are \(n \times 1\)
      matrices, then the dot product \(u \cdot v\) can be computed with a nice
      combination of matrix multiplication and the transpose:
      \begin{equation*}
      u \cdot v = u^T v .
      \end{equation*}
      On the right, this is matrix multiplication! That makes sense because
      \(u^T\) is \(1 \times n\) and \(v\) is \(n \times 1\). This
      means that the result
      is a \(1\times 1\) matrix, i.e. a number.
