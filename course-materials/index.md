title: Materials for Linear Algebra
---

Linear Algebra has been part of the undergraduate mathematics curriculum for a
long time. Since the subject is so widely applicable and useful, there are a great
many introductions available. An Amazon or Google search for "linear algebra" will
turn up too many items to keep in your head at once.

### Strang's Text

My favorite introductory text is our textbook: _Introduction to Linear Algebra_
by Gilbert Strang, which is now it a fouth edition. In particular, I like Strang's
emphasis on the **four fundamental subspaces** and the **Fundamental Theorem of
Linear Algebra**.

Prof Strang is on the faculty
at MIT, and has made many of his materials available. I encourage you to look at
these:

- [MIT OpenCourseWare Math 18.06][ocw]: This is a complete semester of Strang's
  course for which he wrote this text. A whole semester of video lectures is available.

- [Older MIT 18.06][mit]: This has more video, homework and solutions, review
  questions, etc... going back to 1996.

- Strang's [Ideas Site to accompany the book][linalg]

### Our Workbook

To run this class, I am writing (and constantly revising) a workbook to accompany
Strang's text. This is where you will find my commentary on the mathematics, some
instruction on related Sage commands, and your daily homework tasks.

### An Interesting Set of YouTube Videos:

_YouTube_ user 3Blue1Brown has a fantastic set of videos about core geometric ideas
in linear algebra.

### Other Free, Open-Source Materials

There is a bit of momentum building in a small corner of the mathematics community
for creating and using open educational materials. There are two such books on linear
algebra which you might find useful.

  href="http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/">Hefferon's<br class="visible-xs" />

  <a class="btn btn-default btn-lg"
  href="http://linear.ups.edu/">Beezer's<br class="visible-xs" /> First Course in
  Linear Algebra  
  </a>
</div>

These books are written for courses pitched in different ways than ours, so it
may not be obvious how to use them. But it can often help to have a different
viewpoint to read, so I want to make you aware of these.

### The SageMath Linear Algebra QuickRef

Rob Beezer has written a [short and compact handout][quickref] with the most 
useful linear algebra commands on it. You might want a copy to tuck in your
book.

### Books on SageMath

There are two reasonable references for the basics of SageMath (which are not the documentation):

  * The book [Sage for Undergraduates](http://www.gregorybard.com/Sage.html) by Greg Bard, which is free from his webpage.
  * The book [Peering into Mathematics using Sage-colored glasses](http://www.math.usm.edu/dont_panic/) by John Terry, which is free from that site.

### The Sprinter's Guide

In Fall 2006, I taught my first linear algebra course, and along the way I wrote
a decent set of notes. This takes a different point of view than the text we are
using, but I think that people can still get something out of reading it. I am
typing these notes up, and I will make them available.
