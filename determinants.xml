  <title>Determinants</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Our next goal is to find a better understanding of the <term>determinant</term>
      of a square matrix. We have seen this come up before as a measurement that allows
      us to <q>determine</q> if a square matrix is invertible. But it has some more
      information in it than that, and it has some interesting properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our first section will take up the interesting properties, with special attention
      to those properies which make the determinant easier to compute. Then we will
      look at a few alternate methods of computation.
