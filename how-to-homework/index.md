title: How to Do Daily Homework
---

It is my experience that students often do not know how to read a mathematics
text book. This is nothing to be ashamed about, as it is likely no one has ever
tried to teach you how. But successfully completing this course will require
that you can read the text effectively.

Maybe it is already apparent to you that you cannot expect to read a text book
like you read a novel. Abstract ideas just don't stick in your head like "humans and
their stories" do. So, what should you do?

I find it helpful to think instead in terms of "what should I try to make?"
Of course, what you want to make is _understanding_, but I have no idea how to do
that directly. Fortunately, there are several other kinds of things you can
make which will help produce understanding as a by-product.

**Read with a stack of paper at your side and a pen in your hand.**

## How to Read Math: Make Things

Here is a list of the kinds of things you should make when you read mathematics:

  - Short notes on new vocabulary words: what do they mean to you, and what don't
  they mean?
  - Make note of any important theorems or techniques discussed.
  - Worked examples. the text may have some, if so, work through them yourself.
  But there probably aren't enough. Make your own and try them out.
  - (MOST IMPORTANT) A list of questions: Lots of what you read won't quite
  make sense to you, yet. Write down questions about the text in full sentences
  with little question marks at the end.

The key is this: if you do the above, you will be more likely to recall what you
do understand. And if you keep a list of what you don't understand, you can at least
remember what you have to think about more.

By the way, reading material once just doesn't work all that often. You should probably
read the material again after a day or two. Our class work has built-in review days:
use those to re-read. When you re-read, read your notes, too. Have you figured
out the answers to those question, yet? If not, it is time to bug someone about it.
Talk to a classmate. Come to office hours and talk with me. (It's my job and I love to
talk about math with students.)

## How to Do a Daily Assignment

1. Read the section and make notes as described above.
2. Read the workbook and play with the SageMath examples. Add questions about SageMath
to your notes.
3. Work through the tasks at the end of the workbook section. Add your best shot at
solutions to the end of your notes.

Then bring that stack of paper to class. It is your daily homework. You will use it
as we have discussions.
