  <title>Eigendata and the Singular Value decomposition</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      We have studied the algebraic structure of matrices, and we have studied the
      way that these algebraic properties are reflected in a geometric model where
      a matrix represents a transformation from one Euclidean space to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this chapter we shall study how to do this in a different way that cares
      more about the geometry adapted to the specific matrix. First we shall take
      up square matrices, where we will study <term>eigenvalues</term> and
      <term>eigenvectors</term>. We shall see that some matrices can be reimagined
      as if they are diagonal matrices. This idea of <term>diagonalization</term>
      is powerful, but it doesn't always work. We will study one situation where
      we know it will always work in the <term>spectral theorem</term> for symmetric
      matrices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we shall apply all that we have learned this term and put it together
      to study the <term>singular value decomposition</term> of a general rectangular
      matrix. This will be a good geometric understanding of how a matrix behaves
      as a function.
