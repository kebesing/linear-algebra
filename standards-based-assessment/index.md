title: Assessment for Linear Algebra
---

This semester I will use a _Standards Based Assessment_ strategy. I hope that
this will bring some clarity and purpose to our work together. If everything
fits properly, you will find that striving for a higher grade and working hard
for deeper and more complete understanding of the course material are one and
the same.

The basic ideas are these:

- I will set a collection of learning goals for the term, _and make them
  explicit and public_. This way you will understand what things I will try to
  assess in your work.

- I will assign final grades for the course on the basis of demonstrated
  competence on those learning goals.

- Any assignment that is assessed will receive feedback in a way aligned with
  the stated learning goals. This way, it should be clear in which ways you
  should focus your efforts to improve your work.

If I could get away with it, I would not assign grades at all, and just focus on
giving you feedback on your abilities. But the registrar will ask me for grades
at the end of the term, so I need a way to come up with them. Also, some students
seem to need or want the motivation of grading to keep up with coursework. So I
made up this funny system.

### Outline of the "Standards"

These are the big goals I have for learning for the term. In this list, I have
written them as vague ideas.

1. Transitioning mathematical argument
  - Precise use of language & correct use of vocabulary
  - Clear reasoning from examples to generality
2. Communication
  - Oral presentations of ideas
  - clear written communication
3. Technology
  - displayed competence with basic use of a computer algebra system.
4. Linear Algebra Content
  - foundational proficiencies: computational fluency
  - advanced proficiencies: the three pictures, the four central problems,
    explicit vs. implicit descriptions, the Fundamental Theorem of Linear
    Algebra, and other organizing ideas.

### Basic Grading Scheme

At the end of the semester, grades will be assigned based on your achievements
using the following table:

| Grade | Foundational | Advanced | Presentations | Bi-Weekly Hwk | Daily Hwk | Technology |
|-------|--------------|----------|---------------|---------------|-----------|------------|
| A     | 10           | 4        | 6             | 6             | 20        | yes        |
| A-    | 10           | 3        | 6             | 6             | 20        | yes        |
| B+    | 9            | 2        | 4             | 5             | 20        | yes        |
| B     | 9            | 1        | 4             | 5             | 20        | yes        |
| B-    | 8            |          | 4             | 5             | 15        | yes        |
| C+    | 7            |          | 2             | 4             | 15        | yes        |
| C     | 6            |          | 2             | 4             | 15        | yes        |
| C-    | 5            |          | 2             | 4             | 10        | yes        |
| D+    | 4            |          | 1             | 2             | 10        | yes        |
| D     | 3            |          | 1             | 2             | 10        | x          |
| F     | fail         | to       | meet          | standards     | for       | D          |
