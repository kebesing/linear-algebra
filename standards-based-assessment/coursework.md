title: Coursework Assessment
---

There are three types of regular coursework in Math 2500:

  - Daily Homework
  - Class Presentations
  - Weekly Homework

I have decided on a scheme for marking these which feels a little complicated,
but should reward someone who basically keeps up with class work on a regular
basis.

### Daily Homework

For each class meeting you will complete a short set of tasks. These are to be
written up carefully and brought with you. During class, you may mark up your
paper as much as you wish to correct errors, incomplete understanding, or for
any other reason. **All of these annotations will be made with a felt-tip pen.**
At the end of class, I will collect these papers to look them over. Each
daily assignment will be marked with either a 1 or a 0. I will assign a 1 if I
believe you made a good faith effort to attempt each problem and wrote up your
progress in a reasonable manner. (I don't expect you will always get every task
complete and correct. But I do want you to make a good faith effort to get every
task complete and correct.) There will be about 25 of these assignments.

### Class Presentations

We will spend almost all of our time in class meetings with students presenting
their work on the daily tasks. Each will be assessed as a successful or not,
with the following standards in mind:

 - correct use of vocabulary
 - mathematically correct work
 - clear oral presentation

The class conversation which follows your presentation will provide you with
feedback on the quality of your work. Mistakes happen, of course, so don't worry
that these will be handled too strictly.

### Bi-Weekly Homework

As an opportunity to work on your written communication, there will be assignments
every other week or so that ask you to go further into the material and explain
yourself carefully. Often, these will be based on things we have already discussed.
Just as often, these assignments will ask you to use SageMath to do a computation
or make a picture. This is to help break the ice between you and the computer.

  - clarity of written communication
  - correct use of vocabulary
  - clear reasoning from examples to generality
  - correct computational work

  Daily homework may be corrected and resubmitted for credit once. The second
  submission should directly address the comments on the original paper.
