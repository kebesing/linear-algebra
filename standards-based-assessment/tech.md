The math department has specified Linear Algebra as a place where we explicitly
teach and assess student basic competence with a computer algebra system.

The quasi-official policy document describing expectations is here:

When a student feels ready, that student will make an appointment with Prof.
Hitchman to do a technology assessment interview. This will take only 15-20
minutes, and will be done sitting at a computer.

A student who successfully completes the tasks on the assessment script will
receive the credit for one letter grade improvement in the course.

To prepare, students are encouraged to explore the Sage Mathematical Software
System through the SageMathCloud tutorial. See the [Sage][] page for more
information about Sage.
