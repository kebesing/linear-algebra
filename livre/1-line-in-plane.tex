\chapter{The Equation of a Line in the Plane}


\textbf{Outline}
\begin{compactitem}
\item points vs physics vectors vs math vectors
\item the idea of R2
\item sketching points and vectors in the plane
\item vector algebra in R2
\item lines in R2 as parametric objects: through the origin, and not
\item sketching lines in R2
\item lengths, angles, and the dot product in R2
\item normal vector to a line in R2
\item equation of a line, three methods: elimination, from two pts via similar triangles, from geometry of dot product
\item families of parallel lines
\item sketching a line from an equation
\item the big theorem with duality
