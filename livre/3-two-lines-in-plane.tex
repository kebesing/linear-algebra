\chapter{Systems of Lines in the Plane}

\textbf{Outline}
\begin{compactitem}
\item note about how we understand one line in the plane, what about two?
\item idea of three possible outcomes
\item translations into matrix algebra equation: matrix-vector multiplication
\item idea of a solution to a system
\item questions: how can we characterize the three options in terms of the matrix
\item use normals to answer, linear independence...
\item characterization of column space bit??
\item write "solution" as parametric form of the line, or as just point
\item algorithmic solution stuff
