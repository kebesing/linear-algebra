*Linear Algebra*<br />
*Math 2500, Fall 2015*


##Course Description:

This course is devoted to the basics of linear algebra: the study of systems of
linear equations, vectors, matrices, and those things which arise when pursuing
basic questions about these objects further.

Students who complete this course will learn to work _as a mathematician does_.
To meet this challenge, we will run class as an [Inquiry Based Learning][IBL]
(IBL) environment.

Successful students will learn to perform basic computations in linear algebra,
but will also build mental models of the geometry behind linear algebra. They
will be able to describe and use the three pictures (row, column, and transformation)
behind a system of linear equations, and the Fundamental
Theorem of Linear Algebra.

Finally, student will learn the basics of the computer algebra system Sage, including how it
can be used to perform unpleasant computations efficiently and how it can make relevant
visualizations.

## Materials:

- Text: [Introduction to Linear Algebra, 4th Ed.][strang], by Gilbert Strang,
Wellesley-Cambridge Press, 2009, ISBN 978-09802327-14.
- Software: We will use the free, open-source computer algebra system [sage][]. Students
  should make an account at the [SageMathCloud][SMC] site using their UNI email address.
- I will distribute many other materials through the course web page.

## Assessment:

I will be using a “standards based assessment” scheme for this course. See the
[relevant handout][sba] for more detailed information. Grades in this course are
based on the following assessments:

- in-class participation, focusing on finding and presenting solutions
- several in-class assessments focused on linear algebra content knowledge
- bi-weekly written homework
- a "technology" gateway assessment
- an optional project to complete an advanced learning objective

If you feel uncertain about your progress in the course at any time, please
contact me.

**Accommodations:**
  If you have a disability and require accommodations, please contact the
  instructor early in the semester so that your learning needs may be
  appropriately met. You will need to provide documentation of your
  disability to the Student Disability Services (SDS) office, located on the
  top floor of the Student Health Center, (319) 273-2677.

**Academic Learning Center Syllabus Statement**
  I encourage you to utilize the Academic Learning Center’s free assistance with
  writing, math, science, college reading, and learning strategies. UNI’s Academic
  Learning Center, located in 007/008 ITTC, also provides advising services and
  is the University's testing center for many standardized tests, including the
  PLT, GRE, and Praxis Core. Visit the website at `http://www.uni.edu/unialc/` or
  call (319) 273-6023 for more information or to set up an appointment.
