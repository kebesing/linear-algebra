*Linear Algebra*<br />
*Spring 2500, Fall 2016*


##Course Description:

This course is devoted to the basics of linear algebra: the study of systems of
linear equations, vectors, matrices, and those things which arise when pursuing
basic questions about these objects further.

Students who complete this course will learn to work _as a mathematician does_.
To meet this challenge, we will run class as an [Inquiry Based Learning][IBL]
(IBL) environment.

Successful students will learn to perform basic computations in linear algebra,
but will also build mental models of the geometry behind linear algebra. They
will be able to describe and use the three pictures (row, column, and transformation)
behind a system of linear equations, and the Fundamental
Theorem of Linear Algebra.

Finally, student will learn the basics of the computer algebra system Sage, including how it
can be used to perform unpleasant computations efficiently and how it can make relevant
visualizations.

## Assessment

This semester I will use a _Standards Based Assessment_ strategy. I hope that
this will bring some clarity and purpose to our work together. If everything
fits properly, you will find that striving for a higher grade and working hard
for deeper and more complete understanding of the course material are one and
the same.

The basic ideas are these:

- I will set a collection of learning goals for the term, _and make them
  explicit and public_. This way you will understand what things I will try to
  assess in your work.

- I will assign final grades for the course on the basis of demonstrated
  competence on those learning goals.

- Any assignment that is assessed will receive feedback in a way aligned with
  the stated learning goals. This way, it should be clear in which ways you
  should focus your efforts to improve your work.

If I could get away with it, I would not assign grades at all, and just focus on
giving you feedback on your abilities. But the registrar will ask me for grades
at the end of the term, so I need a way to come up with them. Also, some students
seem to need or want the motivation of grading to keep up with coursework. So I
made up this funny system.

### Outline of the "Standards"

These are the big goals I have for learning for the term. In this list, I have
written them as vague ideas.

1. Transitioning mathematical argument
  - Precise use of language & correct use of vocabulary
  - Clear reasoning from examples to generality
2. Communication
  - Oral presentations of ideas
  - clear written communication
3. Technology
  - displayed competence with basic use of a computer algebra system.
4. Linear Algebra Content
  - foundational proficiencies: computational fluency
  - advanced proficiencies: the three pictures, the four central problems,
    explicit vs. implicit descriptions, the Fundamental Theorem of Linear
    Algebra, and other organizing ideas.

### Basic Grading Scheme

At the end of the semester, grades will be assigned based on your achievements
using the following table:

| Grade |  | Foundational |  | Advanced |  | Presentations |  | Bi-Weekly Hwk |  | Daily Hwk |  | Technology |
|-------|--|--------------|--|----------|--|---------------|--|---------------|--|-----------|--|------------|
| A     |  | 10           |  | 4        |  | 6             |  | 6             |  | 20        |  | yes        |
| A-    |  | 10           |  | 3        |  | 6             |  | 6             |  | 20        |  | yes        |
| B+    |  | 9            |  | 2        |  | 4             |  | 5             |  | 20        |  | yes        |
| B     |  | 9            |  | 1        |  | 4             |  | 5             |  | 20        |  | yes        |
| B-    |  | 8            |  |          |  | 4             |  | 5             |  | 15        |  | yes        |
| C+    |  | 7            |  |          |  | 2             |  | 4             |  | 15        |  | yes        |
| C     |  | 6            |  |          |  | 2             |  | 4             |  | 15        |  | yes        |
| C-    |  | 5            |  |          |  | 2             |  | 4             |  | 10        |  | yes        |
| D+    |  | 4            |  |          |  | 1             |  | 2             |  | 10        |  | yes        |
| D     |  | 3            |  |          |  | 1             |  | 2             |  | 10        |  | yes        |
| F     |  | fail         |  | to       |  | meet          |  | standards     |  | for       |  | D          |

### Technology Assessment

The math department has specified Linear Algebra as a place where we explicitly
teach and assess student basic competence with a computer algebra system.

The quasi-official policy document describing expectations is here:

<div class="text-center">
<a href="https://docs.google.com/a/uni.edu/document/d/1Xu_pRDEyK5ATYlInlz3LzOLeOySh6c_F3El8gYKiIZc/edit">
  <div class="btn btn-lg btn-primary">
    Technology SLO Policy
  </div>
</a>
<br />
<br />
</div>

When a student feels ready, that student will make an appointment with Prof.
Hitchman to do a technology assessment interview. This will take only 15-20
minutes, and will be done sitting at a computer.


To prepare, students are encouraged to explore the Sage Mathematical Software
System through the SageMathCloud tutorial. See the [Sage][] page for more
information about Sage.

### Regular Coursework

There are three types of regular coursework in Math 2500:

  - Daily Homework
  - Class Presentations
  - Weekly Homework

I have decided on a scheme for marking these which feels a little complicated,
but should reward someone who basically keeps up with class work on a regular
basis.

#### Daily Homework

For each class meeting you will complete a short set of tasks. These are to be
written up carefully and brought with you. During class, you may mark up your
paper as much as you wish to correct errors, incomplete understanding, or for
any other reason. **All of these annotations will be made with a felt-tip pen.**
At the end of class, I will collect these papers to look them over. Each
daily assignment will be marked with either a 1 or a 0. I will assign a 1 if I
believe you made a good faith effort to attempt each problem and wrote up your
progress in a reasonable manner. (I don't expect you will always get every task
complete and correct. But I do want you to make a good faith effort to get every
task complete and correct.) There will be about 25 of these assignments.

#### Class Presentations

We will spend almost all of our time in class meetings with students presenting
their work on the daily tasks. Each will be assessed as a successful or not,
with the following standards in mind:

 - correct use of vocabulary
 - mathematically correct work
 - clear oral presentation

The class conversation which follows your presentation will provide you with
feedback on the quality of your work. Mistakes happen, of course, so don't worry
that these will be handled too strictly.

#### Bi-Weekly Homework

As an opportunity to work on your written communication, there will be assignments
every other week or so that ask you to go further into the material and explain
yourself carefully. Often, these will be based on things we have already discussed.
Just as often, these assignments will ask you to use SageMath to do a computation
or make a picture. This is to help break the ice between you and the computer.

  - clarity of written communication
  - correct use of vocabulary
  - clear reasoning from examples to generality
  - correct computational work

  Bi-Weekly homework may be corrected and resubmitted for credit once. The second
  submission should directly address the comments on the original paper.

### Standards for Linear Algebra Content Learning

These are organized by the "big questions" that we address throughout the course.
At first, the questions are pretty straightforward and focus on solving systems
of equations. Eventually, the questions become more internal to linear algebra, and
address things that come up in our study of systems, but are definitely at a "second
level."

#### Foundational Goals


##### Question One: What are the basic objects of linear algebra?

 * Vector Algebra (Chapter 1)

    > add vectors, plot vectors, compute scalar multiplication of number and vector,
    > compute linear combinations, geometric interpretations of these operations

 * Matrix Algebra (Chapter 1 and 2)

    > add matrices, take transpose, multiply matrix times vector (two ways),
    > multiply two matrices (three ways), identify troubles with matrix multiplication:
    > commutativity, inverses

 * The Dot Product (Chapter 1)

    > compute the dot product of two vectors, compute angles between vectors,
    > compute length of a vector, normalize a vector, use connection between
    > dot product and linear equations to work with normal vectors

##### Question Two: How can we solve a square system of linear equations?

 * Gauss-Jordan Elimination (Chapter 2)

    > Use Gauss-Jordan and back-solving to solve a system, find LU decomposition,
    > identify when Gauss-Jordan breaks, identify when matrix does not have

    > compute the inverse of a square matrix


##### Question: How can we solve a general system of linear equations?
How can we tell if there is a solution? What shape will the solution set have?
When will the solution be unique? Is there a computationally effective way to
find the solution set?

 * Solving Systems of Equations (Chapter 3)

    > Solve a general (rectangular) system of linear equations using the reduced row-echelon form,
    > special solutions, a particular solution. Give the general solution to a
    > system of linear equations. Compute the rank of a matrix. Use pivots
    > and free variables to reason about the solution set to a system of equations

 * The Four Subspaces (Chapter 3)

    > Compute the null space, column space, row space, and left null space of a
    > matrix. describe these subspaces by giving bases

##### Question: What are the good ways to understand subspaces?

 * Implicit and Explicit Descriptions (Chapter 3)

    > determine when a set of vectors is linearly dependent or linearly independent,
    > determine the span of a set of vectors. determine if a collection of vectors
    > is a basis for a subspace
    > Find a basis for a subspace described using equations,
    > find equations to describe a subspace described using a basis
    > use the row space algorithm and the column space algorithm to find a basis


##### Question: Can we find approximate solutions to systems that do not have an actual solution?

 * Approximate Solutions and Least Squares (Chapter 4)

    > Find the "best" available approximate solution to an unsolvable system
    > of equations, draw pictures explaining how orthogonal projection is relevant,
    > use approximate solutions to fit curves to data

##### Question: Is there a good way to test if a square matrix is invertible?

 * Determinants and the Invertible Matrix Theorem (Chapter 5)

    > Use properties of determinants, compute determinants in a variety of ways,
    > Use the invertible matrix theorem

##### Question: How can we understand the geometry of square matrices as transformations?

 * Eigenvalues, Eigenvectors, and the Spectral Theorem (Chapter 6)

    > Compute eigenvalues and eigenvalues, diagonalize matrices when possible (and
    > recognize limitations), know and use spectral theorem

#### Advanced Goals

##### Question: Are there any good geometric interpretations of a system of linear equations?

 * The Three Viewpoints (Chapters 1 and 2)

    > The row picture, the column picture, and the transformational picture. pass back and forth
    > cleanly pass between the representations, and describe what a solution means in each case.

##### Question: How do we understand matrices as transformations?

 * Four Subspaces and Matrices as Functions (Chapters 3 and 4)

    > Use the four subspaces to describe the action of a matrix as a transformation (function)

    > Use Gram-Schmidt to compute an orthonormal basis for a subspace, decide if a
    > matrix is orthogonal or not, compute the QR decomposition of a matrix

##### Question: Is there a good geometric way to understand the behavior of a general matrix as a function?

 * Singular Value Decomposition (Chapter 6)

    > Compute the SVD of a matrix, reason about the structure of a matrix using
    > the SVD, build matrices with given properties using the SVD.
