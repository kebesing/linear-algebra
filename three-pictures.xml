      <li>Translate back and forth between the three algebraic representations:
        <ul>
          <li>
            A system of linear equations.
          </li>
          <li>
            An equation involving a linear combination of vectors.
          </li>
          <li>
            A matrix equation.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Write down the <m>n \times n</m> <term>identity matrix</term>.
      </li>

      Sometime in the near future, a student should be able to:
    </p>

    </ul>

    <title>Discussion</title>

    <p>
      Now we have a little experience with vectors and related things, it is
      time to be aware of what we have done so we can use it as a foundation for
      future work. So far, we have talked about two geometric interpretations
      for a system of linear equations, the <term>row picture</term> and the
      <term>column picture</term>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Does the following picture make sense to you?
    </p>
    <figure>
      <caption>The three geometric models of linear algebra</caption>
      <image width="95%" source="images/ThreePics.png" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      A deep understanding of linear algebra will involve a level of comfort with
      each of these three views of the subject in the diagram, and also the ability
      to pass back and forth between them.
    </p>

    <subsubsection>
      <title>The Transformational View</title>

      <p>
        We have seen that matrices can be made to "act upon" vectors by a kind of
        multiplication. In particular, if <m>A</m> is an <m>m\times n</m> matrix,
        then <m>A</m> can be multiplied (on the left) with a column vector of size
        <m>n</m>, and the result is a column vector of size <m>m</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This makes <m>A</m> into a kind of <term>function</term>. (We will use
        the synonyms <term>mapping</term> or <term>transformation</term>, too.)
        For every vector <m>v</m> of size <m>n</m>, the matrix <m>A</m> allows
        us to compute a new vector <m>T_A(v) = Av</m> of size <m>m</m>. This is
        the basic example of what professionals call a <term>linear
        transformation</term>.<md>
        <mrow>\mathbb{R}^m &amp; \xrightarrow[]{T_A} \mathbb{R}^n</mrow>
        <mrow>v &amp; \xmapsto[]{\phantom{T_A}} Av.</mrow></md>
        One of our long term goals is to learn to think about the geometry
        of linear algebra from this viewpoint, too.

    <title>SageMath and Plotting for Linear Algebra</title>

    <p>There are a few new SageMath commands that might be useful here. We have
      already seen how to take linear equations and turn them into vectors
      and then turn the vector equation into a matrix equation. But SageMath can
      help us move in the other direction, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      The keys are commands to pull out the rows and columns from a given matrix.
      Let's start with a simple situation where the matrix equation is
      <me>
        \begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}
        \begin{pmatrix} x &amp; y \end{pmatrix} =
        \begin{pmatrix} 3 &amp; 4 \end{pmatrix}.
      </me>
    </p>
    <sage>
      <input>A = matrix(QQ, 2,2, [2,1,1,1]); A</input>
      <output>
        [2 1]
        [1 1]
      </output>
    </sage>
    <sage>
      <input>
        x, y = var('x y')
        X = vector([x,y]); X
      </input>
      <output>
        (x, y)
      </output>
    </sage>
    <sage>
      <input>
        b = vector([3,4]); b
      </input>
      <output>
        (3, 4)
      </output>
    </sage>
    <p>
      To get SageMath to pull out the columns, we can use the <c>.columns()</c>
      method. If we want just one column, we can use the <c>.column()</c> method,
      but then we have to remember to specify which column we want.
    </p>
    <sage>
      <input>
        A.columns() # this will return a list
      </input>
      <output>
        [(2, 1), (1, )]
      </output>
    </sage>
    <sage>
      <input>
        A.column(1)
      </input>
      <output>
        (1, 1)
      </output>
    </sage>
    <p>
      <em>Big important note:</em> SageMath always numbers lists starting with zero.
      so the first element of every list is the <m>0</m> entry, and the second
      element is the <m>1</m> entry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it is possible to make SageMath do things like this:
    </p>
    <sage>
      <input>
        column_plot = plot(A.column(0), color='red')
        column_plot+= plot(A.column(1), color='blue')
        column_plot+= plot(b, color='purple')
        show(column_plot, figsize=5, aspect_ratio=1)
      </input>
    </sage>
    <p>
      This is an example of the a column picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      One can also pull out the rows with corresponding <c>.row()</c> methods.
      And if you
      recall the way that matrix multiplication works if you think of rows, you
      can make a row picture.
    </p>
    <sage>
      <input>
        A.rows()
      </input>
      <output>
        [(2, 1), (1, 1)]
      </output>
    </sage>
    <sage>
      <input>
        expr1 = A.row(0).dot_product(X) == b[0]
        expr2 = A.row(1).dot_product(X) == b[1]

        print expr1
        print expr2
      </input>
      <output>
        2*x + y == 3
        x + y == 4
      </output>
    </sage>
    <p>
      And now the picture:
    </p>
    <sage>
      <input>
        row_plot = implicit_plot(expr1, [x,-5,5], [y,-1,9], color='blue')
        row_plot+= implicit_plot(expr2, [x,-5,5], [y,-1,9], color='red')
        show(row_plot, axes=True)
      </input>
    </sage>
