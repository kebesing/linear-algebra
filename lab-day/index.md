## First Day in the Computer Lab

Before class, students should

  * read through the syllabus and make a list of questions
  * make an account on SMC
  * find and work through the SageMath Beginner's workshop
  * Bring Sage questions

### Phase One: Question Time

Take questions on the policies in the syllabus.

### Phase Two: Basics of SageMath

Take a question or two. Have them sign in.

### Phase Three: New Work!

Have them do three tasks, which I push to them just before class.

1. Make a plot of the line $3x+2y=4$ in the plane.
2. Make a plot of the parametric shape given by
$t \mapsto (4/3, 0) + t*(-2/3,1)$
in the plane. What interesting thing happens?
3. Make a plot of the shape defined by $3x+2y=4$ in three dimensional space.
What kind of shape is this?
4. Ponder: How might we possibly make a plot like the second one for THIS 3d situation?
5. Find the commands for `matrix` and `echelon_form` of a matrix and read the
documentation to see how they work. Find the echelon form of this matrix:
$\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 1 & -2 \\ -1 & 0 & 4/5 \end{pmatrix}$. What do you get?
