## Lesson Plan for First Day of Linear Algebra

**Quickly: Introduce myself and go over names policy**

### Phase One: get started somewhere familiar

Write the following on the board:

Consider
\\[ (\star) \left\\{ \begin{array}{ccccc} 3x & + & 2y & = & 4 \\\\ 2x & - & y & = & 1 \end{array}\right. . \\]

Questions:

1. Any way you can, decide if \\( \star \\) has any solutions. How many solutions
does \\( \star \\) have? What are they?

2. Find some ways to represent the system \\(\star\\) with a picture. Can you find
two different pictures?

3. Can you use your picture from (2) to explain your answer for (1)?

Explain that the thing on the board is called a _system of two linear equations in
two variables_. Ask them to work in pairs or triples on these questions.

While they work, be sure to meet as many students as you can.

### Phase Two: Run a mini-presentation session

Explain the ground rules for how class will run. Then do a presentation by a volunteer.
Help run class the way I want.

### Phase Three: Add on

Probably need to add the linear combination of vectors equation and its picture.
Explain the difference between the "row picture" and the "column picture." Hint at
the transformational picture.

### Phase Four: Extend (time permitting)

Erase the lower left \\(2\\) and replace it with an \\(A\\). Add this question to
the board:

4. Can we choose a value of \\(A\\) so that the system \\(\star\\) as NO solutions?
How many choices of \\(A\\) do this?

Maybe run another presentation.

### Phase Five: Clean up

Point the students to resources:

  * course web page
  * online workbook
  * syllabus handout
  * SageMath (maybe)

Announce that after class a message will arrive by email about the first assignment
and how to do it.
