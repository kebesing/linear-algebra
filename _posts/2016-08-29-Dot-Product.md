title: The Dot Product
date: 2016-08-29 17:00

Today we started discussing the mysteries of the dot product. This odd operation
contains the geometry of Euclidean space in its depths. And as such, it becomes
useful to linear algebra through the fact that two vectors are orthogonal exactly
when their dot product is zero.

Our discussions today relied on interpreting the sign of the dot product in terms of
angles, and on the connection between geometric statements and linear equations.
Please keep this in mind.

Today's presentations were: \#7 Nichols, \#8 Schmidt, \#9 Bettle, \#10 Christoffer,
\#11 Ackerman, and \#12 Tarnow.

### For Wednesday

The assignment is to do reading, watching, and practicing as detailed in our workbook
section on

[Matrices](http://theronhitchman.github.io/linear-algebra/course-materials/workbook/matrices.html)

See you soon!
