title: The Complete Solution
---

Today was a big day. We finally read and discussed how to solve a general system of
linear equation in an algorithmic way. In case you want a quick reminder, it goes
like this:

1. write the system in matrix form: \\(Ax = b \\)
2. write down the augmented matrix \\( (A|d) \\)
3. use Gauss-Jordan elimination to put the augmented matrix in reduced
row echelon form: \\( (R|d) \\)
4. Note the pivots and the free variables.
5. translate back to a system of equations.
6. set all of the free variables to zero, and solve for the particular solution.
7. find all of Strang's "special solutions"
8. write down the answer in the form of "particular solution plus any linear
combination of the special solutions"

You all seemed fairly challenged by the tasks for today. Fortunately, Wednesday is a
catching-up day, so we can take some time to get this correct.

### For Wednesday

We will have our first chapter 3 catching-up day. The tasks which we still need
to discuss are as follows: \# 71, 78, 87, 88, 89, 91, 92.

Note that a new set of assessments will happen on Friday. One will be Solving Systems
and the other will be The Three Viewpoints.
