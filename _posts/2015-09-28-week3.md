title: Week 3 Wrap Up

---

During our third week of class, I missed our meetings. Fortunately, Dr Somodi
was kind enough to cover for me. Here is a quick recap of what happened.

#### Monday, 7 September

No class for the Labor Day Holiday.

#### Wednesday, 9 September

First in-class assessment day. This was your first crack at two different
outcomes:

  * Vector Algebra
  * The Dot Product

#### Friday, 11 September

We began work on Chapter 2 of Strang, which focuses on learning to solve
"square" systems of equations, where the number of equations is equal to
the number of unknowns.

Presentations made:
  * \#2 Stanley
  * \#3 Ancona
  * \#4 Adams
  * \#5 Payne
  * \#6 Betzer
