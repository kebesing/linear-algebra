title: Many New Words for Old Concepts
---

We introduced many words today to help us more carefully describe concepts which
have been building for several weeks:

  - linearly independent sets of vectors
  - linearly dependent sets of vectors
  - spanning sets
  - the span of a set of vectors
  - a basis for a subspace
  - the dimension of a subspace

I also shared with you details about a way of reducing a given spanning set down to
a basis called "the column space algorithm." Like everything else, it turns out
to be an interpretation of the Gauss-Jordan/rref algorithm.

Presentations: \#94 Nichols; \#96 Bettle; \#97 Oswald.

I hope we will come back around and talk about the row space algorithm, soon.
