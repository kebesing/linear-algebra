This was our first review day for chapter 4. The most important thing we did was
look at the picture for orthogonal projections onto a subspace one more time, carefully.

Progress:

  * \# 4.3 Bieghler
  * \# 4.6 Kalishek \amp; HITCHMAN
  * \# 4.8 Bieghler

I can't recall if we actually did that last one or not. I have names in my book,
but not presentation scores...
