title: Subspaces
---

We talked a bit about the idea of a general vector space. This is another spot
where mathematics goes through a serious _abstraction_. (That is a verb.)
But more important for us is the idea of a _subspace_ of some \\(\mathbb{R}^n\\).

As the semester progresses, we will be increasingly reliant on four subspaces
associated to a matrix. We saw the first today: it is called the _column space_.

Presentations: \#67 Audace; \#68 Morgan; \#69 Bettle; \#70 Christoffer; \#72 Meyer.

We skipped \#71 because we ran out of time and I really wanted to make sure we did
\#72 given the conversations we were having about the column space.

### For Wednesday

Please prepare the second section of chapter 3.
