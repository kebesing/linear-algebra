title: Subspaces
---

We talked a bit about the idea of a general vector space. This is another spot
where mathematics goes through a serious _abstraction_. (That is a verb.)
But more important for us is the idea of a _subspace_ of some \\(\mathbb{R}^n\\).

As the semester progresses, we will be increasingly reliant on four subspaces
associated to a matrix. We saw the first today: it is called the _column space_.

### For Wednesday
