title: That was really dull.
---

So, ten students came to class. about six had read the material for the day. Three
had attempted the exercises. only one wanted to present anything.

We talked for a bit about eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the difference between
algebraic and geometric multiplicity, and the beauty of orthogonal matrices (the
  inverse is just the transpose!).

  Mr Tutic presented task \#171.

  For monday, better look through all of that stuff in chapter six.
