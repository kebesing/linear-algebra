title: The Null Space
---

Today was our introduction to the second important subspace related to a matrix,
the _null space_. Or maybe the _nullspace_. I can never decide if I want it to be
one word or two. Anyway, the null space of a matrix \\(A\\) is the collection of
vectors \\(x\\) so that \\(Ax =0\\). That is, the null space is the set of vectors
which the matrix "turns into the zero vector" under multiplication.

Today's presentations from Chapter 3:
* \#1 Giarusso
* \#2 Bundt &amp; Feldmann
* \#7 Schultz
* \#8 Cohen

#### For Monday, 12 October

Prepare with [this section of the workbook.](http://theronhitchman.github.io/linear-algebra/course-materials/workbook/rank.html)

#### A study note

Perhaps you have noticed that each section of the workbook has detailed learning
goals stated quite explicitly. If you go back to chapter one, can you do all of those
things? How about in early chapter two?
