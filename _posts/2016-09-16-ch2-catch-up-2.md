title: Catching Up &colon; and getting distracted
---

So, we had an odd day. Mr De La Bruere presented his work on two of the tasks, and
we talked through things at the whiteboard. Of course, we had to move to WRT 110
because the projector bulb was out.

And I got a bit sidetracked about how to see things in four dimensions... and so
we talked about shadows and  stereographic projection and Henry Segerman's 3d printed
mathematical art, and a even a little about knots.

Oh, yeah. I am teaching a knot theory course next term.

Anyway, for Monday, please prepare the next section of Strang, and [this
accompanying section][wkbk] of the workbook.
