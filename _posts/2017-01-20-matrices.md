I started by collecting Knowledge Surveys. I only got 8 (out of 17) of those
back. Since there were 5 absent students today, I guess that isn't too bad.
I hope to get the rest of them back on Monday. They should take less than 20
minutes to complete.

We got to work: we multiplied a matrix by a vector in two ways:

  * dot product of rows with the column
  * linear combination of the columns of matrix.

Our example was:
<div>
\[ \begin{pmatrix} 3 & 1 & 4 \\ 1 & 5 & 9 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 6 \\5 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 32 \\ 77 \end{pmatrix} \]
</div>

Also, I talked about the "transformational picture," where we think of the
matrix as a kind of function from one space to another.

We had three presentations today, by Prybil, Bundt, and Wilmesherr.

I distributed another handout with pictures from our discussion today via SMC.

### For Monday

Monday is going to be split. We will spend part of the day discussing tasks
we have skipped for lack of time. So far, our list is \#6, 12, 15, 16, 18, 19,
and 20. Please work through those again. We can present at least 3 or 4 of them.

I will also give a short introduction to Radiography and Tomography on Monday.
I am nervous about this, but we'll see how it goes.

### Coming Up: Wednesday

Our First assessment day!
