title: Matrices, for the first time
---

We didn't "finish" a lot of stuff today, though you all worked pretty hard. We spent
fifteen minutes talking about issues with learning to use SageMath. By the way,
I submitted a request about our plotting issue. Also, the worksheets I made while
poking around are now set to "public" and available [here][s1] and [here][s2].

Then we went to our usual discussion mode. In the end, we only presented two tasks.
Mr Kleiss presented \#23, and we got a chance to talk about the row picture.
Miss Martin presented \#24 and we talked about something which will be a
column picture.

I am seriously considering pushing back our calendar a day so we can have some
more discussion about the material in chapter one, but I will leave the decision
until after Monday's class.

For Monday: please review the sections we have already had a chance (however short)
to discuss. We will go straight to presentations. I hope we can get through at least
Tasks \#7-10, 20, 25, and 26. We will probably do more.

Note that the complete list of "unpresented items" is: \#7-12, 20-22, 25-30.
