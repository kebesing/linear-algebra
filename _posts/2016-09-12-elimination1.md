title: Solving Systems with Elimination
---

We started learning the major algorithm of the semester. From one point of view,
about 75 percent of the content in linear algebra is understanding what "Gauss-Jordan
Elimination" is, how it works, and what can happen when you run it.

We got through all seven tasks, which was fantastic.

Also, Mr Oswald danced for us, and that was even better.
