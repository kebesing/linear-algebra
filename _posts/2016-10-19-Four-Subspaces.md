title: The FOUR Subspaces
---

So, we have already seen how useful the column space and the null space of a matrix
can be when trying to solve equations. Today we talked about how there are actually
four subspaces associated to a matrix. The two new ones are the row space and the
left null space. The secret is that these new ones are just the column space and
the null space of the transpose!

We talked some about finding bases for these subspaces when you have the rref of
A and its transpose.
