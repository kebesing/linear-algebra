title: Computing Determinants
---

We discuss the variety of ways to compute determinants for square matrices.
Some of the approaches to keep in mind are:

  * Use row operations to make it simpler, and keep track of the changes along the
    way
  * Expand along a row or column (and do the "recursive" method)
  * Use the shortcuts for \\(2\times 2\\) or \\(3\times 3\\) matrices
  * Use the big formula as a last resort
  * if you can, let a computer do the hard work for you

#### Next Time: Assessments

We will have an assessment day on "Determinants" and "Gram-Schmidt, orthonormal
bases and the QR decomposition"
