title: Day 20&colon; Solving General Systems
tags: section02
---

Today was the day to discuss the general solution method for arbitrary
rectangular systems of linear equations. We talked a bit about how important
the column space and the null space are. We talked a little bit about the
way to view a matrix as defining a function.

Problems Solved:

  * \# 3.19 Teske
  * \# 3.21 Kalishek (with discussion)
  * \# 3.25 Van Nevele (with discussion)

Monday is a "catch-up day." The list of unsolved problems from chapter three is:
4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 20, 22, 23, 24, 26. I would like to get through a lot of those,
especially 20. Miss Wilson has promised to present that one on Monday.

We shall also take some time on Monday to do a reassessment. I will bring reassessments
for Matrix Algebra and the dot product with me to class. You should prepare for
one you need.
