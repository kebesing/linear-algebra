title: Chapter Four Catch Up 1
---

Mr Tarnow presented one leftover piece of a task we did not discuss.

And I did a lot more than usual. I talked about how projections work (again). I
did a big example of how to compute a projection matrix onto a subspace given by
equations.

I talked about how subspaces can be described in two ways: cut out by equations
(and so they look like a null space), and as a span by giving a basis
(so they look like a column space).

And I talked about the process of passing back and forth from one description to
another.
