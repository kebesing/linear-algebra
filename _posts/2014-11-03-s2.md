Today was the day to study least squares approximation, which is really a thin veneer
on top of a way to use orthogonal projection to approximately solve a system that doesn't
have an actual solution.

We drew lots of pictures, and mostly succeeded at solving these straightforward
exercises. The more interesting part is to draw the pictures which correspond.
