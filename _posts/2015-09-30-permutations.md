title: Permutation Matrices

---

Today was our day to talk about permutation matrices, and their relationship with
using row swaps in the Gauss-Jordan Elimination process.

Presentations:
* \#46 Corkery
* \#47 Ancona
* \#48 Cohen
* \#49 Divis and Schiltz
* \#50 Adams

I also took a moment to do a little "where have we been and where are we going" talk.

#### For Friday 2 October

Next time will be our second "Chapter 2 recap" day. We are up to [this section][rev2]
of our workbook, which you can see has some scaffolding for study and review written
in it.

I have tried to keep careful track of which of the 51 items from Chapter 2 we have
discussed and which ones we have not. As I see it, the following remain open for
discussion on Friday:

\#11; \#16; \#18-24; \#38; \#43-45; \#51.

Study up, bring your work and some questions.

#### For Monday 5 October

This coming Monday will be our second in-class assessment day. I plan to make
available the following two assessments that day: Matrix Algebra and Gauss-Jordan
Elimination.

#### Note on Assessments

Many of you have expressed an interest in doing a reassessment of the Vector Algebra
or the Dot Product Standards. I have these ready, and you can take a reassessment
by coming by my office. For example, I will be in from 10 to noon on Thursday morning
and I will hold regular office hours on Thursday and Friday.

Also, the SageMath Assessment can be done at any time you feel ready. That should be
scheduled with me, though, since we have to sit and talk for 15 minutes without
interruption.
