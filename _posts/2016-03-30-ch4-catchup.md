title: Chapter 4 Catch Up day
---

Not much happened. You all don't seem to prep very hard for these catch-up days,
so they have been duds. At least, that is what it looks like to me. Maybe you are
just still intimidated by this new material?

Anyway, Mr Rook presented \#125 and you took some time to talk and work.
