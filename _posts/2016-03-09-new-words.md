title: Lots of New Words
---

We discussed several new words that will help us more precisely discuss the kinds of
structures we have been using for weeks now:

  * linear dependence or linear independence for a set of vectors
  * the span of a set of vectors
  * a basis for a subspace
  * the dimension of a subspace

Presentations: \#108 Moore; \#109 Schmeling; \#111 Lamar.

We got the opportunity to discuss the "column space algorithm," too.
