title: The dot product&colon; geometry enters

---

We had a successful day centered around the ideas in the dot product. The two big themes are:

1. The dot product is a way to rewrite a linear equation, and
2. The dot product contains geometric information about lines and angles.

We had presentations by the following people: \#13 Wen; \#14 Feldman; \#15 Payne; \#16 Tong;
\#17 Cohen; \#18 Rosdail.

During our last conversation, we saw two ways to plot lines quickly using the information in
the equation when presented in the dot product form. (Hint: one used the normal vector and a point, the other used two intercepts.)

### Assignment for Wednesday, September 2:

Read the next section of the text, on matrices, and do the workbook section which corresponds.

### Assignment for Friday, September 4:

On Friday, we will discuss all of the "unsolved problems" we have collected so far. Well, as many as we can get to. So far, this includes tasks 5, 7-10, 12, 13 and 19-22 from the first chapter of the workbook.

Also, the first bi-weekly assignment is due by the end of the day on Friday. You can find it on SageMathCloud.
