We had discussions about many things left over from sections 3.5 and 3.6 of
Strang. Here's my recap list:
* \#28 Kehrli
* \#30 Feldmann
* \#34 Divis
* \#35 Giarusso
* \#37 Ancona

I will collect section 3.6 at our next meeting, so you can study from it.

#### For Wednesday, October 28

Prepare for the first attempt at the following assessments:

* The Four Subspaces
* Implicit and Explicit Descriptions

These are described on the course web site [Content Assessment Page][content].
