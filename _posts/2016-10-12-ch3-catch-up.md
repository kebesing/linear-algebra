title: Chapter 3, Catching Up part 1
---

We have covered a lot of material in the last two weeks. A LOT. It was time to have
a recap day. So, we picked up presentations that had been passed over in the
last few meetings.

Presentations: #\71 De La Bruere; \#78 Lille; \#89 Vijaranakorn; \#91 Parker; \#92 Tarnow.

Then, in response to a request, I sketched out what the _Three Viewpoints_ are.
These are the row picture (systems of equations), the column picture (a linear
combination equation), and the transformational picture (a matrix-vector equation).

### For Friday

Prepare for the next set of assessments: Solving Systems, and The Three Viewpoints
