title: Elimination with matrices
---

Today we had several good conversations about how we can use matrix multiplication
to understand the process of Gauss-Jordan elimination.

We saw:
  * Elimination steps as performed by matrix multiplication,
  * (left) matrix multiplication as a set of row operations,
  * the effect of such matrix multiplication on the column picture.

Presentations were these: \#47 Eggleston; \#48 Hauser; \#49 Martin; \#50 Van Donselaar;
\#52 Tutic.

For Wednesday, please prepare section 2.4.
