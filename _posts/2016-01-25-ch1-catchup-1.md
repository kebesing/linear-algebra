title: Chapter One Discussion&colon; Pictures!
---

We made a lot of progress on Chapter 1 tasks, and discussed several versions of
helpful pictures.

Mr Thein presented \#7; Mr Kleiss presented \#8; Mr Corker presented \#9. Then
we had a short discussion about the "column picture." The word _span_ came up.
More on that later.

Miss Van Donselaar presented \#20, and we got a chance to talk about the concept
of a unit vector, and the _norm_. Remember, _norm_ is just a synonym for _length_.

Miss Schmeling presented \#25 with a very nice picture of a pair of lines
intersecting; Mr Tutic presented \#26 and we got a chance to talk about a picture
with _planes in space_ which don't intersect. These are examples of what we will
call the "row picture."
