title: Orthogonality of Subspaces
---

We discussed the ideas behind orthogonality extended to _subspaces_. And, in
particular, we learned that the four subspaces associated to a matrix are
orthogonal (in pairs, of course). This updates our "big picture" just a little
bit: the subspaces we draw are _orthogonal complements_ of each other.

Mr Stanley presented task \#1; Miss Wen, Miss Ancona, and Mr Payne split up task
\#2, which is had a lot to it; Mr Kehrli presented \#3; Miss Rosdail presented
\#4; and Mr Adams presented \#6.

I asked you all to think about tasks 2 and 3 again using the four subspaces (and
orthogonality) to organize your thinking.
