title: Permutation Matrices
---

Today was our opportunity to discuss permutation matrices, which we will use to
help us track row swaps. Some important things to remember:

* if a GJE process requires row swaps, then you won't get an A=LU decomposition.
Instead, you will get an A=PLU decomposition. Some people prefer to write this
as PA = LU instead. (The matrix P changes from one equation to the other!)

* the transpose is a neat little operation. It will become increasingly important
to us as we continue.

Presentations: \#76 Corker; \#77 Schmeling; \#78 Amos; \#79 Rook; \#80 Thein.

### For Friday
We will have our second chapter 2 "catching up" day. According to my records, here
are the tasks from chapter 2 that we have not, yet, discussed:

\#51, 53, 54, 60, 61, 66, 67, 68, 75, 81

There are also these older items that we didn't even get to in our last "catching up"
day: \# 35, 36, 39, 44, 46.
