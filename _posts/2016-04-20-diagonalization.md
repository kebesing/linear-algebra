title: Diagonalization for square matrices
---

Today we discussed diagonalization. This is another matrix factorization for square
matrices --- one that depends upon using data from eigenvalue/eigenvector pairs.

Presentations include: \#165 Schmeling; \#166 Tutic; \#169 Bertacini

For next time, please prepare section 6.4 of Strang and the corresponding part of the
workbook. This will introduce a powerful theorem about diagonalization for
symmetric matrices.

Then I told you about my favorite matrix, and its connection to the Arnol'd-Avez Cat
Map, a hyperbolic toral automorphism.
