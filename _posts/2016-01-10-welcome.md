This course blog will serve a dual purpose. First, it will give us all a
common record of what transpires in class. Second, it will be a way for me to
make announcements.

So, if you happen to miss a day, you can keep up by following along here. And if
you find you can't recall what happened on a particular day, or who had which
great idea, this is the place to look.
