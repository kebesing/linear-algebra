I have been underneath a pile of work, and so I have not posted here
as regularly as I wished. But right now I am catching up! (On this, at least.)

We have had three days of discussion about the material in chapter 3. The main
problem we are considering is how to solve a general system of linear equations
\\(Ax = b\\). Here the matrix \\(A\\) may not be square!

On Day 17, we had a long discussion about what makes a vector space, and in particular,
what makes a subspace. Basically, we want linear combinations to make sense. We had
these presenters:

  * \# 3.1 Schulte
  * \# 3.2 Banker
  * \# 3.3 Ratz
  * \# 3.4 McGee
  * \# 3.6 Doore

On Day 18, we had a discussion about the difference between implicitly defined
subspaces (given by equations) and parametrically defined subspaces (given by
what we will eventually call a "basis".) These were the presenters:

  * \# 3.7 Fangman
  * \# 3.8 Ratz
  * \# 3.9 Burken
  * \# 3.10 Nelson
  * \# 3.11 Banker
  * \# 3.12 Doore

On Day 19, we pushed further into our understanding of Nullspaces and the RREF.
The presenters were:

  * \# 3.13 Bavido
  * \# 3.14 Nelson
  * \# 3.15 Ratz
  * \# 3.16 Sorensen
  * \# 3.17 McGee
  * \# 3.18 Reinard

Note that so far, we have only ONE unsolved task from chapter 3. This is pretty
incredible. Monday will be a review and catch-up day, but it looks as though we won't
have much catching up to do. This frees us up to do a reassessment on Monday.
