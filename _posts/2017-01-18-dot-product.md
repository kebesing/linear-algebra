title: The Dot Product

Good work everyone. We are progressing nicely. Today was our first day to talk
about the dot product. The cool thing is that the dot product contains lots
of geometric information (lengths and angles!), and it also provides us
a compact way of writing linear equations.

Administrative stuff: I handed out the knowledge survey, to be completed and
returned on Friday. Then we talked about the calendar a little bit. Things are
still in flux because I am trying to fit in some lab work about the math
behind radiography and tomography (basically, reconstructing a 3d model from a
CAT scan is a big linear algebra problem.) I think I will take some time to
introduce those ideas on Monday.

So, we handled tasks 7 through 11 today. Our presenters were: Bundt, Tompkins,
Feldman, Happel, and Mogadishu. We'll save \#12 for our catch-up day.

### For Friday

Please prepare by doing the work indicated in the next section of the
workbook: [Matrices](http://theronhitchman.github.io/linear-algebra/course-materials/workbook/matrices.html)

Matrices are the third major object of study in our course. By the end of the
term, we will have studied them very deeply. I even know of someone who teaches
a similar course, but calls it _matrixology_.
