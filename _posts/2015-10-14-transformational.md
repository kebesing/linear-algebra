title: The transformational picture
---

today was our day to learn how to solve equations. Instead of the usual
routine, I got distracted and drew lots of pictures.

These are _good_ pictures, though. We talked about the **transformational**
view of a matrix, where the matrix becomes a kind of function. We added
details by talking about where the null space appears in this picture
and where the column space appears. We looked at a couple of examples to
make things a bit more concrete.

So, we have lots of problems to solve and discuss next time. Come prepared.
I did not collect today's homework, but I will collect it next time.

#### For Friday, 16 October

Prepare to discuss the "un-presented tasks" from chapter 3. My list of
these is: \# 3, 5, 6, 9, 12, 17-26. That is a lot. I will try to
prioritize 8-10 of them. I doubt we can get all of them done in a day.

#### Next Assessments

On Monday we will have an assessment day. I plan to hand out first versions
of these two assessments:

  * Solving Systems (foundational)
  * The Three Viewpoints (advanced)

Please remember that you can find descriptions of the kinds of things I
look for in each assessment [at this page][assessment].
