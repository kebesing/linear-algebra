title: The Transformational Picture, version 2
---

I started class by discussing how one might think of an \\(m\times n\\) matrix
as defining a kind of function \\(\\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^m\\).
We put the words "domain" and "target" in the appropriate places, and then showed
where the null space and column spaces sit in this picture.

We took some time to discuss, but there were no student presentations. I presented
\#96 and \#97 at your request.
