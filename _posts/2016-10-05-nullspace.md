title: The Null Space
---

I gave a short talk on the basics of the "transformational picture" for understanding
a matrix. I made this version of the picture on the board, which has the column
space and the null space on it.

We talked a bit about the null space. We talked about how Gauss-Jordan helps us
find a simpler set of equations for describing a subspace. And we saw again that
linear equations define large, flat subspaces, called hyperplanes. Intersecting those
hyperplanes allows us to describe smaller subspaces.

Presentations: \#73 Lillie; \#74 Reihman; \#75 Fuhs; \#76 Nichols; \#77 De La Bruere.

We did not discuss \#78 because we ran out of time.

### For Wednesday:

prepare the next section of Strang and the workbook.
