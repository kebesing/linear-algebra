Our discussion today centered around several new linear algebra terms that should
help us be more precise when discussing several of the geometric ideas that keep
coming up.

* linear independence
* linear dependence
* spanning set
* basis
* dimension

We had a little Q&amp;A about these basic terms for about 15 minutes. Then we
transitioned into our usual mode of work.

Mr Brown presented on \#27 and Mr Payne presented on \#28. Neither of these really
got "finished." After those presentations we had a short chat where I tried to
help you all see the connection between these types of questions about vectors
and questions that can be asked about the fundamental subspaces of matrices.
In the end, we only really have one tool set right now: row reduction as represented
by Gauss-Jordan Elimination. Things get much easier to deal with if you can
reinterpret your question as one about some matrix in RREF involving pivots and
free variables! Try that with these items.

#### For Friday, 23 October

Work on [this section of the workbook][workbook] and the accompanying stuff in Strang.

[workbook]: http://theronhitchman.github.io/linear-algebra/course-materials/workbook/four-subspaces.html

You will see the appearance of two new subspaces associated to a matrix, which brings
our total to _four_.
