We had our first catching-up day. Here is what happened:

  * I took questions.
  * You presented work on tasks we left behind previously.

Presentations were: \#3 Parker; \#6 Nichols; \#16 Tarnow.

We did not get to \#19 or \#20.

  * We talked more about the column picture, and I made [this SageMath worksheet in
  class.](https://cloud.sagemath.com/projects/36700d99-c2a8-4515-86e5-c925d1af1355/files/2016-09-02-142940.sagews)
  * I gave a short outline of the structure of our course, including pointing out
  that "learning how to systematically solve these kinds of problems" is part of
  the work of Chapter 2 and 3, and soon you will all be experts.
  * and then something terrible happened.

**I LIED.** It was terrible. I previewed what you are supposed to do for Wednesday,
but I got it all wrong. What I talked about (starting chapter two, etc etc) is
actually the work for Friday. I am sorry. I got ahead of myself.

### For Wednesday

Prepare for the first assessment day! On Wednesday in class I will distribute the
first version of _Vector Algebra_ and _Dot Product_ assessments. You can find a
reasonable description of what I will be looking for
[in the syllabus]({{site.baseurl}}/syllabus/), at the bottom in the section titled
_Standards for Linear Algebra Content Learning_. These are both "core" assessments.
