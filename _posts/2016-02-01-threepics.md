title: Three Pictures
---

Today was our day to discuss the three viewpoints. I gave a quick overview of
what they were, with special attention to the "transformational view."

We had three presentations: Miss Van Donselaar presented \#31; Mr Thein presented
\#32; Mr Moore presented \#33.

For Wednesday, please prepare section 2.2 of the workbook.

Also, if you plan to submit a revision of the first bi-weekly assignment, that is
due by the end of the day on Wednesday.
