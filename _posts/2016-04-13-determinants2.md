title: More Determinants
---

We talked more about determinants today. Presentations included: \#152 Amos;
\#153 Thein; \#154 Thein; \#155 Flesch; \#156 Martin; \#157 Bertacini

An interesting thing that came up is that you can compute determinants with a
_recursive_ mindset. We talked about what that means.

We also took another look at the invertible matrix theorem.
It is a very useful and important thing.
