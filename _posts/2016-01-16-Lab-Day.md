We spent time on two major things today.

1. We played with the capabilities of SageMathCloud. Get comfortable, and see if you can
   meet the following challenge:

   > Use the `implicit_plot3d` command to make a plot of two intersecting
   > planes in three-dimensional space. The planes should be different colors.
   > Investigate the options for `color`, `opacity`, and `aspect_ratio`.

2. I modeled the process I use for reading mathematics text for understanding.
   The key ideas are these:

   * Take everything apart, line by line.
   * Take notes on what you read. Actively sort out the ideas.
   * Work out as many examples as you can for yourself. If there are not enough,
     make your own.

For Wednesday, please read section 1.2 of Strang (about the dot product), and do
the associated tasks in the workbook.

I am working on the first "bi-weekly Sage assignment." It will come out soon.

Have a good weekend.
