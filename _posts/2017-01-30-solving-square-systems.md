title: Solving Square Systems

We discussed the mechanics of using "elimination and back-solving" for finding
the solutions for square systems of equations. This is the start of a
conversation about an algorithm that will allow us to efficiently handle
the general basic linear algebra task.

There is a lot of new vocabulary that comes along with all of this, so we tried
to do a little retrieval practice on the words: pivot, singular, upper (lower)
triangular system, forward pass, and back-solving.

Our tasks today had us try to create interesting examples with certain features.
I view this as the most important thing you can do to learn the subject. You
want to have a large stack of examples that you understand deeply.

Presentations were: \#27 Bertacini; \#28 Folkers; \#29 Prybil; \#30 Cochran.
And we did a group discussion on \#33. The case of two lines in the plane is
not so bad. The case of three planes in space gives eight different options, I
think. In a minute, I will try to make a list of those pictures and send that
along.

### For Wednesday

Please prepare [this section of the workbook.][wkbk] This is more about
Gauss-Jordan elimination as an algorithm, and how we might interpret it using
matrices to represent the row operations.
