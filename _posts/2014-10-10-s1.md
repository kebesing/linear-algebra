title: Day 20&colon; solving equations!
tags: section01
---

Today was the big day! We finally discussed how to find the complete set of solutions
to an arbitrary rectangular system of linear equations. And we got just a minute to talk
about the importance of the column space and the null space, too.

The day's work:

  * \# 3.19 Bavido
  * \# 3.20 Doore
  * \# 3.23 Matthes
  * \# 3.24 Ratz
  * \# 3.25 McGee
  * \# 3.26 Nelson

On Monday we will split our time. Part of the time will be "catch-up" for those
items from chapter 3 we have yet to discuss: \# 5, 21, and 22.

The rest of the time we will take an opportunity to do reassessments. I will design
reassessments for the Matrix Algebra standard, and one for the Dot Product Standard.
You should prepare to take one of those you have not, yet, satisfied.
