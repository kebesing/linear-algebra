title: Chapter Three Wrap Up
---

Today we wrapped up work on chapter three material. We had several presentations by
students, but then I gave a (very fast) review lecture on the following ideas:

  - The Big Picture
  - Describing subspaces with equations and with a basis
      * the column space algorithm for deciding which vectors in a spanning set
      are not needed in a basis
      * the row space algorithm for turning some spanning set into a (possibly very
      different) basis
      * How going from equations to a basis is just "solving a system Ax=0," and
      hence just about finding a null space.
      * How going from a basis to equations is finding the constraint equations
      for when a variable vector lies in a column space.

I also wanted to talk about "effective computation of bases of all four subspaces",
but we were running low on time. So I only gave the quick and easy version:

    Given matrix A, use the rref to compute a basis for the column space and a basis
    for the row space, and a basis for the null space (the special solutions).
    To find a basis for the left null space, you will have to actually find
    RREF of the transpose first.

If we have time later, we can talk about a slightly shorter method that involves
an augmented matrix.

### For Monday

Prepare for the next assessment papers:

  - The Four Subspaces
  - Implicit and Explicit Descriptions
