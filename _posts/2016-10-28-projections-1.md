title: Orthogonal Projection
---

We discussed the concept of orthogonal projection of a vector onto a subspace.
This _looks_ tricky, but once you see how the picture fits together it is not so
bad. The way to figure it out from scratch uses all that we have learned about
the four subspaces associated to a matrix.

Presentations: \#112 Audace; \#114 Nichols.
