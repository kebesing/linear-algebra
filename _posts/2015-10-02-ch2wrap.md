title: Chapter Two Wrap day
---

We had a class in two parts. First, I gave a short overview of the material
developed in Chapter 2. The main idea is that we learned to solve _square_ systems
of linear equations. But along the way, we discovered that matrices were a
useful computational/bookkeeping tool. Matrices then took on a bit of a life of
their own, and we studied the way that our solution process (Gauss-Jordan Elimination)
is translated into the algebra of matrix multiplication. This led us to understanding
things like the difficulties of finding the inverse of a matrix, and the LU, PLU,
and LDU decompositions. (Okay, I left out the PLDU decomposition.)

The second part of class we used to discuss tasks that we had not done before.
These tasks got discussed:

* \#18 Kehrli
* \#19 Divis
* \#22 Bundt
* \#43 Gravert
* \#44 Conger

#### For Monday, 5 October

We will have an assessment day. I will make available the assessments on Matrix
Algebra and Gauss-Jordan Elimination. You can find details of what these assessments
are about on the [content standards page][csp].
