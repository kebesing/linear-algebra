title: The Rank of a Matrix
---

We talked about the idea of the rank of a matrix. This is just a fancy way of keeping
track when you count pivots. We saw lots of examples of how counting pivots and
free variables is really useful. You can compare the rank to the number of columns
and the number of rows and learn a lot about a matrix.

We also got a chance to review how you bundle together elimination matrices and
make a reduced row echelon form, and to look at the three pictures in a particular
example.
