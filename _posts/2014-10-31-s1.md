Our first review and catch-up day for chapter four made us reconsider orthogonal
projections and the four subspaces more deeply.

The highlight of our meeting was the detailed version of the "big picture" for
task 4.5.

Progress to report:

  * \# 4.3 Spurgeon
  * \# 4.5 HITCHMAN
  * \# 4.6 Banker
  * \# 4.8 McGee
  * \# 4.10 Doore
