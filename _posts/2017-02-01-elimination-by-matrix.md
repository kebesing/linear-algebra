title: Elimination by Matrix
date: 2017-02-01
---

We talked a little about using matrices to do elimination. The key here is that
matrix multiplication can be organized _by rows_. Specifically,
<span>\\(EA = U\\)</span> can be computed by thinking of the rows of
<span>\\(E\\)</span> as holding coefficients for making linear combinations
of the rows of <span>\\(A\\)</span>, and those linear combinations get
stored in <span>\\(U\\)</span>. We did this quite explicitly when talking about
task \#32 when Mr Warner presented it. There his "permutation" matrix did the
job of rearranging rows by using lots of ones and zeros to be coefficients.

Ms Tomkins presented \#35, which gave us a simple example of an elimination realized in several different forms.

Then I did task \#37 in a SageMath worksheet, which I have shared with all of
you. I hope you can see how useful a tool SageMath can be. I know it can feel
intimidating at first, but it is quite powerful, and not as hard to use as you
might think.

### For Friday

Friday is a chapter 2 review day. We have not, yet, discussed these items from
chapter 2:

  \#26, 31, 32, 36, 38, 39, 40.

As we discussed, I will not be joining you. But I encourage you to use the class
time to discuss and review. Make a list of questions for me and I will try to
answer as many as I can when I get back.
