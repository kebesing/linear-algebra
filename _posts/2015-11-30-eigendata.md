title: Eigenvalues!
---

Today was a bit unusual. First, you had to do the "student evaluation of
instruction" instruments. Then we had a conversation to decide how to adjust the
calendar and expectations for the last two weeks of class. By the time all that
was done, there wasn't much room for math. But we did manage to talk about some
basics of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Miss Schultz presented \#158, and Miss Ancona presented \#159.

#### Here I copy out some of the email message I sent on Monday night:

Our schedule for the remaining 5 meetings will be as follows:

Wed 12/2 --  section 6.2
Fri 12/4 -- section 6.3
Mon 12/7 -- catching up day for chapter 6
Wed 12/9 -- Assessment day
Fri 12/11 -- TBA:: we can decide this later. I can easily show you the basics of how
Google runs a page ranking algorithm using linear algebra, or we can do a review and discussion day.
Mon 12/14 -- Final Exam as scheduled by the registrar


On Wednesday next week, you will have a first chance at the "Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors" standard. That won't take a whole class to complete. I think if you let me know by Monday next week, I can arrange to hand you a different assessment to take along with that one. (no use is wasting time) But let's have that wait until Monday. Don't tell me today.

On Final Exam day, I will bring reassessments for all of the possible remaining standards that people in class have not yet met. Show up a little early, and I'll let you pick out the papers you want to try during the testing period.

About the grading table::

This plan cuts out our time to talk about the SVD. I am sad about this, but it will be okay. So, the top part of the grading table for the semester will have to be adjusted, since we lose one of our four advanced content objectives.

The portion of the table which have to do with content mastery now looks like this:

A       10 foundational  3 advanced
A-      10 foundational  2 advanced
B+       9 foundational  2 advanced
B         8 foundational  1 advanced
B- and below is the same as before
