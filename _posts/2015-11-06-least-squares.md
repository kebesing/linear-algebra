title: Least Squares Day
---

Today we discussed the idea of using projections in linear algebra to fit
polynomial curves to data. The big idea involves thinking of functions as vectors
in a certain way, and projecting onto subspaces that represent polynomials of
bounded degrees.

We only got through 5 of the 8 tasks for the day. Oh, and this is the "new" numbering
system.

  * \#131 Bundt
  * \#132 Feldmann
  * \#133 Kay
  * \#134 Schiltz
  * \#135 Eldash

We will pick up tasks 136-138 on our next catching-up day.
