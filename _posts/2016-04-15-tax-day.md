title: Assessments Day 6
---

We did our 6th round of in-class assessments. Today's topics were:

  * the determinant (foundational)
  * Gram-Schmid, orthonormal bases, and the QR decomposition (advanced)

With this, we have now attempted 12 of the 14 different outcomes for the semester.
Of those, 9 are Foundational topics, and 3 are Advanced topics.
We have two topics remaining: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors (foundational) and the
Singular Value Decomposition (advanced).

For Monday, please prepare section 6.1 of the workbook (and Strang). This is an
introduction to the concepts of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. We are finally back
on the official calendar.
