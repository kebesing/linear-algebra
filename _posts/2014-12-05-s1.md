Today I sketched out the idea behind the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of a
general matrix. In case you hadn't noticed, I like drawing diagrams.

We didn't have a lot of student presentations, so there are still many problems
open for Monday.

  * \# 6.24 Bostian (by hand) &amp; Reinard (with Sage)
  * \# 6.26 Hitchman
