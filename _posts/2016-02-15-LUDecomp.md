title: The \\(LU\\) Decomposition
---

So, it turns out that if you track the way Gauss-Jordan Elimination works by
using matrices, you can also pick up a neat "factorization" or "decomposition"
theorem for matrices. It doesn't work all the time, but it works often enough
that it is useful to know about. Many matrices can be written in this way
\\[ A = L U \\]
where \\(L\\) is a lower triangular matrix and \\(U\\) is an upper triangular
matrix. We discussed this factorization and how to find it in the most direct
way possible. _Note:_ this is one of the reasons that I have insisted on the fact
that there is a special way to reduce matrices called the Gauss-Jordan Elimination
algorithm and that we should do that algorithm carefully and in the specified way.
If you do Gauss-Jordan the rigorous way, the LU decomposition is a natural byproduct.

### What's coming up?

Wednesday: permutation matrices (and how to handle things when you need a row swap)
Friday: chapter 2 catch up day
Monday: second assessment day. I think we will take our first stabs at Gauss-Jordan
and Matrix Algebra
