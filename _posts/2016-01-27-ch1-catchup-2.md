title: Second Chapter One Catchup Day
---

Whew. That one was hard work. Here's what happened:

  * Ms Sanders presented on Task 11.
  * Mr Flesch presented on Task 12, and I gave him a terrible time. We talked
  for a bit about trying to sort out the nature of the task: what things were
  supposed to design, and what things count as "a solution" in this setting.
  * Mr Thein presented on Task 21. This gave us a chance to discuss the
  "row picture," where we can use the geometry of planes in space to address
  the task. We noted that this might be a way to reason about finishing task 12,
  too.
  * Mr Rook presented on Task 22. In this case, we saw the rows come back! But now
  the system has a special form, it is "triangular." Mr Rook used a technique
  called "back-solving" to finish his argument.

Then I did a quick review. We have seen TWO of the important geometric ways to
think about a system of linear equations: the row picture and the column picture.
The third viewpoint involves matrices, and it will become more important and more
clear later.

Friday is Assessment Day \#1. We will take the Vector Algebra assessment and the Dot Product 
assessment.
