Today was our day to start discussion on eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The computations
are not hard, as they involve _no new tools_ at all.

The fun part will be what extra understanding we can get out of these.

Today's Progress:

  * \# 6.1 Becker
  * \# 6.2 Fangman
  * \# 6.3 Ratz
  * \# 6.4 McGee
  * \# 6.5
  * \# 6.6 Ratz
