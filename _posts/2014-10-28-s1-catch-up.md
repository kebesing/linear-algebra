It has been a while since I have been organized enough to post here, so it is time
for a montage!, I mean a catch-up post.

### October 15

This was a day to talk about independence, bases, spanning sets, and dimension.

  * \# 3.27 Banker
  * \# 3.28 Ratz
  * \# 3.29 HITCHMAN
  * \# 3.30 Becker
  * \# 3.32 Becker

### October 17

This was a reassessment day.

### October 20

We ended up with a really rich discussion about \# 36. Mr Matthes started our
discussion, but we went to small groups and then a whole class talk.

### October 22

This would have been a "catch up" day, but we spent so much time on 36 in the
previous class, we had a lot to do. This was the day to draw the first version of
the big picture.

  * \# 3.34 Sorensen
  * \# 3.35 Reinard
  * \# 3.37 Ratz
  * \# 3.38 Banker

### October 24

No class. Mental health day. (and travel for Dr Hitchman)

### October 27

The beginning of chapter four, and a chance to enrich our big picture.

  * \# 4.1 Ratz
  * \# 4.2 Matthes
  * \# 4.4 Banker
