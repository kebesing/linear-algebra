title: The Dot Product--Connecting Algebra and Geometry
---

We worked through tasks about the dot product. This important structure is
mysterious, but it contains information about how to measure lengths (called
a "norm" in our context) and angles. It also will help us connect the
algebra of linear equations to the geometry of hyperplanes in mumble-mumble
dimensional spaces.

Things went as followed:

  * Mr Corker presented on task 13, and then we had a discussion about
    the easiest way to graph lines in the plane and planes in space when you
    are given just the standard form.
  * Miss Nommensen presented task 14
  * Mr Moore presented task 15 and Mr Tutic presented 16. These led to a
    discussion of the geometry of angles and how the sign of the dot product
    reflects that.
  * Mr Rook presented task 17 and Mr Gravert presented 18. This led us to a
    discussion about how linear equations like \\(3x + 4y = c \\) form a family
    of parallel lines. The coefficients control the slope of the lines in the
    family, and the number \\(c \\) tells us which line in the family we are
    dealing with.
  * Mr Eggleston presented task 19, and we used this opportunity to draw more
    pictures.
