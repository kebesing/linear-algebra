Today we talked through some of the material from chapter 2 we find challenging.


  * How a matrix behaves as a transformation. (We spent a lot of time on this.)
  * How the Gauss-Jordan process relates to the lu-decomposition.


### For Friday

Prepare for the assessments you asked to have prepared.
