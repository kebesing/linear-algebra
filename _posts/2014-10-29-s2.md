Today was a day to talk about projections. This topic is traditionally difficult for
students, and I am not surprised we didn't get too far.

  * \# 4.7 Van Nevele
  * \# 4.9 Takahashi started this one...

Mr Takahashi's presentation led us to a long conversation where I talked more than
I wanted to. The key is to see these:

1. the transition from implicit description (cut out by equations) to explicit
   description (parametrically described with a basis)
2. The tricky picture involved in projecting onto a subspace.

I will try to construct a picture to help with the second one.

For Friday, we will do a review and catch-up day. Please prepare Chapter 4 \# 3, 6, 8, 9, 10.
