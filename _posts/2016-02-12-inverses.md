title: Matrix Inverses
---

Today we got a chance to talk about matrix inverses. This was our first chance to
run a "full Gauss-Jordan" implementation on matrices which are not small.

I hope you all take the lesson that you don't want to do this kind of thing by
hand if you can help it. It is important to understand what the process is about.
That is why we practice with small systems. But if your matrix is 4-by-4 or larger,
things are generally really messy to do Gauss-Jordan Elimination with paper and
pencil. You will have a lot of basic arithmetic to do, and some if it will go
wrong. And it will take a long time.  Using a computer to do the grunt work will
fix both of these issues for you.

Presentations: \#62 Amos; \#64 Rook; \#65 Van Donselaar.

And I shared with you the [SageMathCloud worksheet](smc) that I made today.

For Monday, please prepare section 2.7 of the workbook, which is keyed to section
2.6 of Strang.
