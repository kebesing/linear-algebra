title: Orthogonality for Subspaces
---

We discussed the concept of orthogonality for subspaces, and that allowed us to
complete the _Fundamental Theorem of Linear Algebra_.

    The row space and the null space of a matrix are orthogonal complements of each
    other. The same is true of the column space and the left null space.
