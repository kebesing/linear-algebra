title: The Null space
---

Another important subspace associated to a matrix \\(A\\) is called the
null space. It consists of those vectors \\(x\\) which satisfy \\(Ax = 0\\).
The null space will help us understand how big the potential solution set of
the system \\(Ax = b\\) will be.

We talked a bit about how this connects to the row picture, and how we might
count dimension of a subspace.
