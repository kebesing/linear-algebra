title: Permutation matrices

Today we discussed permutation matrices, which help us encode the operations of
row interchanges, much in the same way we have tried to use lower triangular
matrices to track elimination steps.

Presentations: \#61 Feldman, \#62 Cochran and Prybil, \#63 Audace, \#64 Truniger.

### For Wednesday

We will have our second "catching up" day for chapter two. I have combed
through my notes, and I believe this is the set of tasks that we have not, yet,
discussed.

    26, 31, 32, 36, 37, 39, 40, 45, 48, 52, 53, 54, 58, 59, 60, 65, 66

That seems like a lot (seventeen items!) but chapter two has 46 tasks in it.

Come prepared to

    * present
    * ask questions
    * dig in to the math

### For Friday

We will have a second assessment day in class. I will pass around a sign-up sheet on Wednesday to see which items you each want to reassess.
