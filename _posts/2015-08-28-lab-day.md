Well, that was unnerving for me. But I hope it was successful for you. By now,
you should

* have an account at [SageMathCloud](https://cloud.sagemath.com);
* have at least one project in that account;
* have a sample worksheet with some basics in it; and,
* have completed working through this worksheet to get a feel for the system.

Later, you will complete the _Technology Assessment_, and Sage is a decent choice
for that. In the meantime, perhaps you can see how SageMath can help you do
unpleasant calculations and make good visualizations.

### Assignment for Monday:

Please read section 1.2 of Strang on "The Dot Product". Also, read through the
[workbook section which corresponds](http://theronhitchman.github.io/linear-algebra/course-materials/workbook/dot-product.html). You should complete the exercises labeled 13 through 22 at the end of
that section and bring them to class. I will collect them at the end of class.

Oh, if you missed the email, go take [my survey about office hours.] (https://docs.google.com/a/uni.edu/forms/d/1yyHP8uHF0HPJrL6CsrszmqcK_yrhDjb-GZpnXA7eDxU/viewform)
