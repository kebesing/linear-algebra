title: Properties of the Determinant
---

We take up the formal study of the determinant function. We have previously seen
that for a square matrix \\(A\\), the determinant of \\(A\\) is a number
which tells us if \\(A\\) is invertible or not.

Now we discuss how the determinant function behaves when we apply different sorts
of row operations to the matrix.
