title: Catching Up in Chapter 2, part 2
---

Today we did a bit of discussing things that hadn't been done before.
Presentations included: \#46 Parker; \#50 Schmidt; \#51 Fuhs; \#60 Ackerman.

There was a dinosaur. Mr Lillie asked an interesting question about breaking the
LDU decomposition, and I rambled some stuff about polar coordinates.

### For Friday

Please prepare for the next round of assessment papers: Matrix Algebra, and
Gauss-Jordan Elimination.

As usual, you can find information on these assessments in the syllabus. (Just keep
  scrolling. It is near the bottom.)
