title: The LU Decomposition
---

We talked about how to keep track of Gauss-Jordan Elimination steps in a slightly
different way, and how that leads to a "Matrix Factorization Theorem." Often, we
can write a matrix \\(A\\) in the form \\(A = LU\\) where \\(L\\) is a lower
triangular matrix with \\(1\\)'s on the diagonal, and \\(U\\) is an upper triangular
matrix.

This doesn't _always_ work, but it works often enough. Next time we will talk about
the cases where it doesn't work, and how we can adjust.

Also, we discussed the variant \\(A = LDU\\) which can be done if \\(A\\) is non-singular.

Presentations: \#54 Christoffer; \#55 Schmidt; \#56 Oswald; \#57 Ackerman;
\#58 Vijaranakorn; \#59 Schmitt.

We didn't get to \#60, so we will save that for the next catching up day.

### For Monday

Please prepare the next section of the workbook, on [Permutation Matrices][wkbk].

### Coming Up soon

Next week we will do new material on Monday, a review &amp; catch-up on Wednesday,
and have new assessment papers on Friday.
