Today's meeting was fun for me. Thanks for playing along. I was a bit amazed to
see how big choices in my class structure came up in your ideas. Did you all
read through the web site in advance and tell me what I wanted to hear? It
didn't feel like it. Anyway, you should clearly see the following features that
you all said you wanted:

- allowing for student revision
- some group work
- general empathy from all of us for each of us
- students presenting their work and getting feedback

We will start with **Linear Algebra** proper on Wednesday. To prepare, please
read section 1.1 of Strang and do the accompanying part of the workbook.
