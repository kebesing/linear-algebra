title: Chapter Three Catching Up, Part 1
---

We had our first "catch up" day for Chapter 3. We had the following presentations:
* \#5 Adams
* \#12 Giarusso
* \#17 Conger
* \#19 Wen
* \#20 Schiltz

After Mr Schiltz's presentation, we talked about what happened in his task was this:

He started with a description of a subspace as a column space of a matrix. This
is a "parametric" or "explicit" description. But his work found a set of equations
which must be satisfied by the coefficients of a vector so that it lies in that
space. This gives us a set of equations which "cut out" the subspace as an intersection
of hyperplanes. This is an "implicit" description.

In a way, this is solving the typical linear algebra but backward! Usually, someone
hands you a system of equations, and you want to find the solutions, and it involves
writing down a linear combination of some _basis vectors_. This time, we have been
handed the vectors, and we have found a decent set of equations describing the same
subspace.

#### Assessments on Monday!

We will have an assessment day on Monday. I will hand out the first versions of
these two assessments:

* Solving Systems
* The Three Viewpoints
