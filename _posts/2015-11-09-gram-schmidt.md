title: Gram-Schmidt and QR
---

Today we learned a new algorithm: The _Gram-Schmidt Orthonormalization Process_.
That is a mouthful. Anyway, it is a rather straightforward method for taking
some basis of a subspace and improving it to obtain an orthonormal basis for
that subspace. Associated to this new algorithm, we got a new decomposition theorem
for matrices, the \\(QR\\) decomposition.

We got through all six items on our discussion list, which is wonderful.

  * \#139 Adams
  * \#140 Wen
  * \#141 Brown
  * \#142 Cohen
  * \#143 Eldash
  * \#144 Ancona

There is some extra depth to \#141, so I want to return to that one. There is something
to that connection between doing Gram-Schmidt on \\(A\\) and Gauss-Jordan on \\(A^T A\\).

#### For Wednesday, 11 November

Prepare the following items for discussion: 136, 137, 138, and 141.

That is only four items. I bet we will have time for other disucssion. Bring any
questions you might have accumulated from your study.
