Today I sketched out the idea behind the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of a
general matrix. In case you hadn't noticed, I like drawing diagrams.

We didn't have a lot of student presentations, so there are still many problems
open for Monday.

  * \# 6.21 Johnson
  * \# 6.22 Hitchman
  * \# 6.26 Kalishek

We tried a few others, but they needed more work.
