Today our work was much more challenging. I asked stranger questions, and I demanded
answers that had more geometry in them. This probably made you uncomfortable. That
is okay. I know that I ask challenging questions -- and that you might not answer
them all. But I think by working towards these kinds of things you will learn
what I am after. I don't expect you to understand everything all in one go.
I do have every bit of confidence that with hard work you will be able to handle
all of these things after some effort and discussion. (I wouldn't ask you to do
something I thought you had no chance of succeeding at.)

Today's presentations: Miss Wen on \#23; Mr Conger on \#24; Miss Divis on 28.

Next time we will do a "Chapter One Catch up day." This means we will take time
to discuss some of those things we haven't, yet. And I might take a few moments
to give a first look at the pictures I hope you will learn to see.

#### Assignment for Friday, 9/4:

Go back through the work we have done so far and study. What can you do more easily
now? What is still challenging? Make a census. Prepare to present some things
that haven't been presented, yet.

#### Bi-Weekly Assignment \#1 is due Friday before 5pm
