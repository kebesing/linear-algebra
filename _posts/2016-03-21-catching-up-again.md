title: Catching up in chapter 3
---

Today we discussed tasks from the last few sections of chapter 3 that we had
previously missed.

Miss Lamar presented \#111. This led us to a conversation of what conditions
are equivalent to the statement "A is invertible."

Mr Flesch presented \#115. This led us to a conversation about finding the four
subspaces associated to a matrix as a computational task.
