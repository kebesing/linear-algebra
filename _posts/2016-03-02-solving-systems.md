title: Solving Systems
---

Today was a big day! We discussed how to find the complete solution set to any
system of linear equations. This involves both the column space (in an indirect
way) and the null space of the coefficient matrix.

We had a nice chat about how counting pivots and free variables and comparing
these with the sizes \\(m\times n\\) of the matrix can give us lots of information.
