Today was our day to start discussion on eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The computations
are not hard, as they involve _no new tools_ at all.

The fun part will be what extra understanding we can get out of these.

Today's Progress:

  * \# 6.1 McDowell
  * \# 6.2 Teske
  * \# 6.3 Bieghler
  * \# 6.4 Nogueira
  * \# 6.5 Van Nevele
  * \# 6.6
