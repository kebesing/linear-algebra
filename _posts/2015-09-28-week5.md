Further into the mysteries of matrices.

#### Monday, 21 September

This was a day to catch up and recap. Presentations:
  * \#1 Giarusso
  * \#7 Adams
  * \#8 Kehrli
  * \#9 Conger
  * \#10 Schiltz

We also shared a SageMathCloud worksheet with the class by email.

#### Wednesday, 23 September

Lots of in depth discussion about matrix multiplication as an abstract
operation on this day.

Presentations:
  * \#26 Schultz
  * \#27 Walz
  * \#28 Divis
  * \#29 Brown
  * \#30 Rosdail
  * \#31 Conger

We discussed \#25 as a class. My favorite three ways to multiply matrices
are to realize \\( A*B \\) as
  1. use the rows of \\(A\\) as coefficients and form linear combinations
     of the rows of \\(B\\).
  2. use the columns of \\(B\\) as coefficients and form linear
     combinations of the columns of \\(A\\)
  3. use the dot product of rows of \\(A\\) with columns of \\(B\\).

#### Friday, 25 September

This was a tough day on Gauss-Jordan Elimination. The hardest thing for
students is always that GJE is a _very specific algorithm_. You can use
row operations in lots of ways, but GJE is a particular way to do it. Why
do we care? For really large matrices, GJE is proved to be the fastest way
to solve a generic system/row reduce a generic matrix.
