title: Projections!
---

We discussed projections today. For this semester, all of our projections are
"orthogonal projections" in that the vector \\( e = Pb -b \\) is orthogonal to
the subspace. Out in the wider world there are lots of other kinds of projection.

Anyway, today we had these presentations:

  * \#6/126: Hitchman
  * \#7/127: Kay
  * \#8/128: Cohen
  * \#9/129: Giarusso
  * \#10/130: Conger
