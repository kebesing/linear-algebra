Okay, this site is updated and running! These posts will serve as a way for me to
keep a quick record of what happens in each class each day. You might find it
useful, too.

On Monday the 11th, we talked about the purposes and structure of really learning
something new. I imagine most of you are taking linear algebra because it is
required of you, but it really is "the best part of mathematics." What I mean is
this: linear algebra is the part of mathematics that humans understand _very well_.
I wish other things were as well digested and clear as what we have to learn about.

At the same time, people generally feel challenged by some parts of the subject:

  * The level of abstraction ramps up pretty quickly in this course
  * This is likely your first exposure to working and thinking in spaces of dimension
  three or more.
  * There is a ton of new vocabulary to learn how to use, and you have to use it
  properly to say anything intelligible.

So, we have our work cut out for us. But at the end, you will have a really powerful
tool set for dealing with all sorts of interesting questions: Linear Algebra.

On Wednesday the 13th, we modeled how class will generally run! (Finally.) You
worked hard on the tasks I set about vectors (Strang section 1.1), discussed them
in small groups, and then volunteers presented their ideas and we talked through
things as a class. This went really well, and I was please that after Mr Amos'
presentation we had a chance to start thinking about the "column picture." This
is one of the three different geometric viewpoints that I want you to learn to
use.

Presentations: \#1 - Flesch; \#2 - Kleiss; \#3 - Marten; \#4 - Daisy; \#5 - Amos;
\#6 - Gravert.

On Friday, we will meet in the computer lab in WRT 110. Please do the Sage workshop
beginner's worksheet before class and read through section 1.2 (the dot product).
