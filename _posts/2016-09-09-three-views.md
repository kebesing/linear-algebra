title: Three Viewpoints on Linear Algebra
---

I started with a mini-lecture about the three geometric viewpoints which I find
helpful for thinking about linear algebra problems:

  * the row picture where we intersect hyperplanes
  * the column picture where we make linear combinations reach a particular point
  * the transformation picture, where we look for an input to a function to reach
  a certain output

Then you worked in (new) teams and presented on the tasks for the day. We had a
good chat about task 25, and how "two independent directions" was enough for us
to reach all of the plane. You laughed at my pictures, which was almost as good as
having you laugh at my jokes.

Presentations: \#21 Feldman; \#22 Oswald; \#23 Schmitt; \#24 Nichols; \#25 Reihman

We didn't get to \#26, so we will save that for our next "catching-up" day.

### For Monday

Please read the next section of Strang and
prepare [the section of the workbook][wkbk] which corresponds. Our next section is
exciting, as we begin to learn how to systematically solve systems using _elimination_.
