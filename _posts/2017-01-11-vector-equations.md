I am really pleased at the work you all did for today. Good job.

We discussed several examples of solving equations written in the form of
linear combinations of vectors. Usually we were trying to understand something
where the unknowns you seek show up as _coefficients_, like the \\(\lambda\\)
and \\(\mu\\) in this example:

\\[ \lambda \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + \mu \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\]

We managed to discuss the first five of our tasks, so we'll have to pick up
number six another time. Our presenters included: Truniger, Bertacini, Cochran,
Gaffey, and Wilmesherr.

An important feature of our discussion today was looking at
"the column picture," where each vector is drawn as an arrow in space, and we
can reason about the shapes generated by taking linear combinations.

### For Friday:

Your assignment is in [this section of the workbook about getting acquainted with Sage](http://theronhitchman.github.io/linear-algebra/course-materials/workbook/start-sage.html)
Please ignore the out of date bit about Fall 2016. I just haven't updated that
to be "semester agnostic."
