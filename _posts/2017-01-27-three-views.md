title: The Three Viewpoints
date: 2017-01-28 12:15

I returned assessments and we discussed the process for reassessments. Then we
discussed the three different geometric viewpoints on linear algebra:

  * the row picture
  * the column picture
  * the transformational picture

We had these presentations: \#21 Warner, \#22 Wilmesherr &amp; Bundt,
\#23 Mogadishu, \#24 Folkers, \#25 Prybil.

Then I did a little mini-lecture about the three viewpoints centered around
the example
<div>
\[
\left\{
\begin{array}{rrrrr}
3x & + & y & = & 2 \\
51x & + & 17y & = & 4
\end{array}
\]
\right.

### For Monday

Prepare [this section of the workbook][wkbk], where we start to learn a
formal system for efficiently solving systems of linear equations.
