title: Week Four Wrap Up

---

More progress on solving square systems in week 4, with a focus on
understanding the process using matrices.

#### Monday, 14 September

The big ideas for the day were (1) recognizing what is a pivot, and (2)
when a matrix is _singular_.

Presentations:
  * \#11 Ancona
  * \#12 Rosdail
  * \#13 Stanley
  * \#14 Kehrli
  * \#15 Corkery

#### Wednesday, 16 September

No class due to continued troubles for me.

#### Friday, 18 September

From here on out, we are a day behind the offical class calendar. It will
remain that way for a bit (maybe the whole term).

We had a big conversation about how matrix multiplication works. In the
end, we only had a single presentation on \#17 by Miss Divis.
