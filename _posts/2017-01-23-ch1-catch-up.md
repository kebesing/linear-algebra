I collected more Knowledge Surveys. The class is up to 14/17. Those last three
of you, bring them with you Wednesday!

We took time to discuss items we had missed before. So, now we have talked about
all of our homework tasks except for \#6 and \#20. I will post a solution
to \#6 on SageMathCloud in the next hour.

Presentations today: Prybil, Warner, Folkers, Truniger, Mogadishu

### For Wednesday

Assessment Day! We will take the day to do first attempts at assessments for
the following content standards:

  * Vector Algebra
  * Dot Product

See the syllabus for more detailed information about those expectations.
