title: Subspaces &colon; The column Subspaces
---

Today we discussed the idea of a subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\), and paid
particular attention to the column space of a matrix. The column space of a
matrix \\(A\\) will be the object that helps us understand when an equation
\\(Ax= b\\) has a solution or not.

In particular, Miss Sanders had a nice method of finding a description of the column
space: she augmented the matrix \\(A\\) with a vector full of variables, then
applied Gauss-Jordan elimination to find equations which must be satisfied
in order for the original system \\(Ax=b\\) to have a solution. This is useful,
and is an example of turning an explicit/parametric description of a subspace
(given by a basis) into an implicit description of the subspace as being "cut out"
by some equations.
