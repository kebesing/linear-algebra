Today we practiced with SageMath through the SageMathCloud service. I will not
collect the assignment I asked you to do in class today, but I still think you
should do it. Also, I put the examples I did at the front of the room in your
projects as a handout.

We discussed the syllabus and policies briefly, too. I welcome other questions
if you come up with any.

Oh, and my office hours are 3-4:30 most days. I have been lonely. Come by and
see me to talk math, or whatever.

### For Monday

No Class! UNI will be celebrating Martin Luther King, Jr. Day with an official
holiday.

### For Wednesday

Please prepare [this section of the workbook][dotproduct]. It is about the
dot product, which is a funny kind of multiplication-ish operation for vectors.
What is amazing is how much information the dot product contains: basically all
of the geometry of lengths and angles is hiding in this thing.
