title: Assessment Day 4
---

Today we did an initial assessment for these foundational standards:

  * The Four Subspaces
  * Implicit vs Explicit Descriptions

#### For Friday, 30 October

Please prepare the first section of Chapter 4. You can find the [proper section
of the workbook here][wkbk]. It is now time for us to start addressing two
questions:

1. We have found out how to describe subspaces with bases. Can we find
_geometrically good_ bases?
2. Not every equation \\(Ax = b\\) has a solution. In the cases where there is
not a solution, can we find a decent approximate solution?

The dot product will help us answer these questions.
