title: Matrices and Elimination
---

Today we talked about matrix multiplication and its relationship to the elimination
process. In particular, we saw how to organize a multiplication \\(Av\\) by
thinking about linear combinations of columns of \\(A\\). Then we also saw how to
think about a multiplication \\(AB\\) by thinking about using the rows of \\(A\\) as
coefficients to form a linear combination of the rows of \\(B\\).

We also had a very brief introduction to what will eventually be the \\(A = LU\\)
decomposition of a square matrix into a lower triangular matrix times an upper triangular
matrix.

We were having some trouble with SageMathCloud access today on the free servers, so
we decided to skip those.

Presentations: \#26 (a catch-up) Tarnow; \#34 Herng; \#35 Morgan; \#38 Dunn.

### For Friday

We will have our first chapter two catch-up day. The tasks we will discuss are all
SMC tasks: \#36, 37, 39, 40. Please have a good look at those.

If you want a structure for review, have a look at [this section of the workbook.][wkbk]
