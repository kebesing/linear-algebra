title: Ch2 Catch Up Day
---

We did an early "catching up" day, since we managed so few presentations earlier
this week. Our accomplishments are as follows:

  * \#34 Martin
  * \#37 Thein, but we did not finish this conversation.
  * \#41 Amos, and then Corker
  * \#42 Flesch
  * \#43 Nommensen
  * \#45 Van Donselaar

For Monday, February 8, please work on section 2.3 of Strang and the workbook.
(That should put us back to our regular "one day behind the calendar.")
