        <title>The Assignment</title>
        <ul>
            <li>Read Chapter 4 section 2 of <em>Strang</em>.</li>
            <li>Read the following and complete the exercises below.</li>
        </ul>

        <title>Learning Goals</title>
        <p>Before class, a student should be able to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Compute the projection of a vector onto a line.</li>
            <li>Find the projection matrix which computes the projections of vectors onto a given line.</li>
            <li>Draw the schematic picture of a projection: the line, the vector, the projected vector, and the difference.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Sometime after class, a student should be able to:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Compute the projection of a vector onto a subspace.</li>
        <li>Find the projection matrix which computes the projections of vectors onto a given subspace.</li>
        <li>
            Explain the process for finding the equations which determine the projection matrix, and say
            why the transpose makes an appearance.
        </li>
        </ul>
