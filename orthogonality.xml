  <title>Orthogonality</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      We introduced the dot product in Chapter One, but we have not found a lot
      of use for it so far. In this chapter, we pick it back up and see what
      we can do with it. Of course, the dot product hides a lot of geometry
      in its mysteries, but for us the key is the notion of <em>orthogonality</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this chapter we will address two important questions:
      <ol>
        <li>
          How can we find <em>approximate solutions</em> to equations <m>Ax=b</m>
          when we know (or suspect) that finding a true solutions is impossible?
        </li>
        <li>
          How can we use geometry to find a <em>good</em> basis for a subspace?
        </li>
      </ol>
      The answers to both of these questions will involve using the dot product
      to check for orthogonality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, to begin, we shall explore the idea of <em>subspaces</em> being orthogonal,
      rather than just vectors, and strengthen the Fundamental Theorem of Linear
      Algebra.
