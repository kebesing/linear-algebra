title: Weekly Assignments
---

About every other week, you will complete a short writing assignment. These
assignments are your chance to practice clear mathematical writing and
get feedback on your work. Please write complete explanations, paying attention
to grammar and style. Mathematics is written in prose, with sentences and
paragraphs!

I will make these assignments available to you through your SageMathCloud account,
in a project which we can both access. You can find the assignment as both a
markdown file (*.md) and a *.pdf. The content is the same. You should do
your work in a SageMathCloud worksheet (*.sagews) and _leave it in the same
folder_. That way, I can collect it automatically at the deadline.
