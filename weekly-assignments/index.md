title: Weekly Assignments
---

Each week, you will complete a short writing assignment. Weekly assignments are your chance to practice clear mathematical writing and
get feedback on your work. Please write complete explanations, paying attention
to grammar and style. Mathematics is written in prose, with sentences and
paragraphs!

Weekly Assignment \# 5 is available through the SageMathCloud. Sign in, and you
should find a new project that I created for you. Inside will be a directory
for this assignment. I should be able to _automatically collect_ this assignment
at the deadline, which is Thursday, October 9 at 10pm CDT.
